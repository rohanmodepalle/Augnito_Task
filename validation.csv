susceptibility,who is at risk for lymphocytic choriomeningitis lcm ,lcmv infections can occur after exposure to fresh urine droppings saliva or nesting materials from infected rodents  transmission may also occur when these materials are directly introduced into broken skin the nose the eyes or the mouth or presumably via the bite of an infected rodent persontoperson transmission has not been reported with the exception of vertical transmission from infected mother to fetus and rarely through organ transplantation
information,what is are parasites  trichuriasis also known as whipworm infection ,whipworm trichuris trichiura is an intestinal parasite of humans the larvae and adult worms live in the intestine of humans and can cause intestinal disease the name is derived from the worm’s distinctive whiplike shape
exams and tests,how to diagnose parasites  schistosomiasis ,"stool or urine samples can be examined microscopically for parasite eggs stool for s mansoni or s japonicum eggs and urine for s haematobium eggs the eggs tend to be passed intermittently and in small amounts and may not be detected so it may be necessary to perform a blood serologic test

susceptibility,who is at risk for parasites  toxocariasis also known as roundworm infection ,"infected dogs and cats shed toxocara eggs in their feces into the environment once in the environment it takes  to  weeks for toxocara larvae to develop and for the eggs to become infectious humans or other animals can be infected by accidentally ingesting toxocara eggs for example humans can become infected if they work with dirt and accidentally ingest dirt containing toxocara eggs although rare people can be infected by eating undercooked or raw meat from an infected animal such as a lamb or rabbit because dogs and cats are frequently found where people live there may be large numbers of infected eggs in the environment once in the body the toxocara eggs hatch and roundworm larvae can travel in the bloodstream to different parts of the body including the liver heart lungs brain muscles or eyes most infected people do not have any symptoms however in some people the toxocara larvae can cause damage to these tissues and organs the symptoms of toxocariasis the disease caused by these migrating larvae include fever coughing inflammation of the liver or eye problems
    
a us study in  showed that  of dogs younger than  months deposit toxocara eggs in their feces other studies have shown that almost all puppies are born already infected with toxocara canis research also suggests that  of all cats are infected with toxocara cati infection rates are higher for dogs and cats that are left outside for more time and allowed to eat other animals in humans it has been found that almost  of the us population has been infected with toxocara globally toxocariasis is found in many countries and prevalence rates can reach as high as  or more in parts of the world there are several factors that have been associated with higher rates of infection with toxocara people are more likely to be infected with toxocara if they own a dog children and adolescents under the age of  are more likely to test positive for toxocara infection this may be because children are more likely to eat dirt and play in outdoor environments such as sandboxes where dog and cat feces can be found this infection is more common in people living in poverty geographic location plays a role as well because toxocara is more prevalent in hot humid regions where eggs are kept viable in the soil"
prevention,how to prevent parasites  scabies ,"when a person is infested with scabies mites the first time symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested however an infested person can transmit scabies even if they do not have symptoms scabies usually is passed by direct prolonged skintoskin contact with an infested person however a person with crusted norwegian scabies can spread the infestation by brief skintoskin contact or by exposure to bedding clothing or even furniture that heshe has used
    
scabies is prevented by avoiding direct skintoskin contact with an infested person or with items such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person scabies treatment usually is recommended for members of the same household particularly for those who have had prolonged skintoskin contact all household members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the  days before treatment should be machine washed and dried using the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be drycleaned items that cannot be drycleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week scabies mites generally do not survive more than  to  days away from human skin children and adults usually can return to child care school or work the day after treatment
    
persons with crusted scabies and their close contacts including household members should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid aggressive and sustained response
    
rooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use environmental disinfestation using pesticide sprays or fogs generally is unnecessary and is discouraged"
susceptibility,who is at risk for parasites  taeniasis ,"the tapeworms that cause taeniasis taenia saginata t solium and t asiatica are found worldwide eating raw or undercooked beef or pork is the primary risk factor for acquiring taeniasis persons who dont eat raw or undercooked beef or pork are not likely to get taeniasis
    
infections with t saginata occur wherever contaminated raw beef is eaten particularly in eastern europe russia eastern africa and latin america taeniasis due to t saginata is rare in the united states except in places where cattle and people are concentrated and sanitation is poor such as around feed lots when cattle can be exposed to human feces tapeworm infections due to t solium are more prevalent in underdeveloped communities with poor sanitation and where people eat raw or undercooked pork higher rates of illness have been seen in people in latin america eastern europe subsaharan africa india and asia taenia solium taeniasis is seen in the united states typically among latin american immigrants taenia asiatica is limited to asia and is seen mostly in the republic of korea china taiwan indonesia and thailand
    
a disease called cysticercosis can occur when t solium tapeworm eggs are ingested for example people with poor hygiene who have taeniasis  with or without symptoms  will shed tapeworm eggs in their feces and might accidentally contaminate their environment this can lead to transmission of cysticercosis to themselves or others

prevention,how to prevent parasites  taeniasis ,"one way to prevent taeniasis is to cook meat to safe temperatures a food thermometer should be used to measure the internal temperature of cooked meat do not sample meat until it is cooked usda recommends the following for meat preparation
   
     for whole cuts of meat excluding poultry 
     
       cook to at least ° f ° c as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat then allow the meat to rest for three minutes before carving or consuming
     
     for ground meat excluding poultry 
     
       cook to at least ° f ° c ground meats do not require a rest time
     
   
   
according to usda a rest time is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature after it has been removed from a grill oven or other heat source during the three minutes after meat is removed from the heat source its temperature remains constant or continues to rise which destroys pathogens

prevention,how to prevent parasites  babesiosis ,"steps can be taken to reduce the risk for babesiosis and other tickborne infections the use of prevention measures is especially important for people at increased risk for severe babesiosis for example people who do not have a spleen avoiding exposure to tick habitats is the best defense
   
babesia microti is spread by ixodes scapularis ticks which are mostly found in wooded brushy or grassy areas in certain regions and seasons no vaccine is available to protect people against babesiosis however people who live work or travel in tickinfested areas can take simple steps to help protect themselves against tick bites and tickborne infections
   
    
   
   
during outdoor activities in tick habitats take precautions to keep ticks off the skin
   
     walk on cleared trails and stay in the center of the trail to minimize contact with leaf litter brush and overgrown grasses where ticks are most likely to be found
     minimize the amount of exposed skin by wearing socks long pants and a longsleeved shirt tuck the pant legs into the socks so ticks cannot crawl up the inside of the pants wear lightcolored clothing to make it easier to see and remove ticks before they attach to skin
     apply repellents to skin and clothing follow the instructions on the product label 
     
       products that contain deet nndiethylmetatoluamide can be directly applied to exposed skin and to clothing to help keep ticks away by repelling them the product label includes details about how and where to apply the repellent how often to reapply it and how to use it safely on children
       permethrin products can be applied to clothingboots not to skin actually kill ticks that come in contact with the treated clothing and usually stay effective through several washings
     
   
   
    
   
   
after outdoor activities conduct daily tick checks and promptly remove any ticks that are found thorough daily tick checks are very important the i scapularis nymphs that typically spread b microti are so small about the size of a poppy seed that they are easily overlooked but they usually must stay attached to a person for more than  hours to be able to transmit the parasite
   
     remove ticks from clothing and pets before going indoors
     conduct a fullbody exam for ticks use a handheld or fulllength mirror to view all parts of the body be sure to check behind the knees between the legs grointhighs between the toes under the arms armpits around the waist inside the belly button the back of the neck behind and in the ears as well as in and around the scalp hairline and hair remember to check children and pets too
   
   
remove ticks that are attached to the skin as soon as possible preferably by using pointed finetipped tweezers grab the tick’s mouth parts close to the skin and slowly pull the tick straight out with steady outward pressure until the tick lets go

susceptibility,what is the risk for my pet for rabies ,"any animal bitten or scratched by either a wild carnivorous mammal or a bat that is not available for testing should be regarded as having been exposed to rabies
  
unvaccinated dogs cats and ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately if the owner is unwilling to have this done the animal should be placed in strict isolation for  months and vaccinated  month before being released
  
animals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a casebycase basis dogs and cats that are currently vaccinated are kept under observation for  days
  
small mammals such as squirrels rats mice hamsters guinea pigs gerbils chipmunks rabbits and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to cause rabies among humans in the united states bites by these animals are usually not considered a risk of rabies unless the animal was sick or behaving in any unusual manner and rabies is widespread in your area
  
however from  through  woodchucks accounted for  of the  cases of rabies among rodents reported to cdc woodchucks or groundhogs marmota monax are the only rodents that may be frequently submitted to state health department because of a suspicion of rabies in all cases involving rodents the state or local health department should be consulted before a decision is made to initiate postexposure prophylaxis pep
  is there rabies in my area
  
each state collects specific information about rabies and is the best source for information on rabies in your area in addition the cdc publishes rabies surveillance data every year for the united states the report entitled rabies surveillance in the united states contains information about the number of cases of rabies reported to cdc during the year the animals reported rabid maps showing where cases were reported for wild and domestic animals and distribution maps showing outbreaks of rabies associated with specific animals"
exams and tests,how is rabies diagnosed,"in animals rabies is diagnosed using the direct fluorescent antibody dfa test which looks for the presence of rabies virus antigens in brain tissue in humans several tests are required
 
rapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis of rabies in humans and other animals is essential for timely administration of postexposure prophylaxis within a few hours a diagnostic laboratory can determine whether or not an animal is rabid and inform the responsible medical personnel the laboratory results may save a patient from unnecessary physical and psychological trauma and financial burdens if the animal is not rabid
 
in addition laboratory identification of positive rabies cases may aid in defining current epidemiologic patterns of disease and provide appropriate information for the development of rabies control programs
 
the nature of rabies disease dictates that laboratory tests be standardized rapid sensitive specific economical and reliable"
frequency,how common is botulism,in the united states an average of  cases are reported each yearof these approximately  are foodborne  are infant botulism and  are wound adult intestinal colonization and iatrogenic botulism also occur but rarely outbreaks of foodborne botulism involving two or more persons occur most years and are usually caused by homecanned foods most wound botulism cases are associated with blacktar heroin injection especially in california
complications,are there complications from botulism,botulism can result in death due to respiratory failure however in the past  years the proportion of patients with botulism who die has fallen from about  to  a patient with severe botulism may require a breathing machine as well as intensive medical and nursing care for several months and some patients die from infections or other problems related to remaining paralyzed for weeks or months patients who survive an episode of botulism poisoning may have fatigue and shortness of breath for years and longterm therapy may be needed to aid recovery
susceptibility,who is at risk for parasites  leishmaniasis ,"leishmaniasis is found in people in focal areas of more than  countries in the tropics subtropics and southern europe the ecologic settings range from rain forests to deserts leishmaniasis usually is more common in rural than in urban areas but it is found in the outskirts of some cities climate and other environmental changes have the potential to expand the geographic range of the sand fly vectors and the areas in the world where leishmaniasis is found
    
leishmaniasis is found on every continent except australia and antarctica
    
      in the old world the eastern hemisphere leishmaniasis is found in some parts of asia the middle east africa particularly in the tropical region and north africa with some cases elsewhere and southern europe it is not found in australia or the pacific islands
      in the new world the western hemisphere it is found in some parts of mexico central america and south america it is not found in chile or uruguay occasional cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis have been acquired in texas and oklahoma
    
    
the number of new cases per year is not known with certainty for cutaneous leishmaniasis estimates of the number of cases range from approximately  million  to  million  for visceral leishmaniasis estimates of the number of cases range from approximately  million  to  million  the cases of leishmaniasis evaluated in the united states reflect travel and immigration patterns for example many of the cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in us civilian travelers have been acquired in common tourist destinations in latin america such as in costa rica
    
overall infection in people is caused by more than  species types of leishmania parasites which are spread by about  species of phlebotomine sand flies particular species of the parasite are spread by particular sand flies the sand fly vectors generally are the most active during twilight evening and nighttime hours from dusk to dawn
    
in many geographic areas where leishmaniasis is found in people infected people are not needed to maintain the transmission cycle of the parasite in nature infected animals such as rodents or dogs along with sand flies maintain the cycle however in some parts of the world infected people are needed to maintain the cycle this type of transmission human—sand fly—human is called anthroponotic in areas with anthroponotic transmission effective treatment of individual patients can help control the spread of the parasite"
prevention,how to prevent parasites  toxoplasmosis toxoplasma infection ,"people who are healthy should follow the guidelines below to reduce risk of toxoplasmosis if you have a weakened immune system please see guidelines for immunocompromised persons
   reduce risk from food
   
to prevent risk of toxoplasmosis and other infections from food
   
     freeze meat for several days at subzero ° f temperatures before cooking to greatly reduce chance of infection
     peel or wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating 
     
      
     
     wash cutting boards dishes counters utensils and hands with hot soapy water after contact with raw meat poultry seafood or unwashed fruits or vegetables

the us government and the meat industry continue their efforts to reduce t gondii in meat
   reduce risk from the environment
   
to prevent risk of toxoplasmosis from the environment
   
     avoid drinking untreated drinking water
     wear gloves when gardening and during any contact with soil or sand because it might be contaminated with cat feces that contain toxoplasma wash hands with soap and warm water after gardening or contact with soil or sand
     teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection
     keep outdoor sandboxes covered 
     
      
     
     feed cats only canned or dried commercial food or wellcooked table food not raw or undercooked meats
     change the litter box daily if you own a cat the toxoplasma parasite does not become infectious until  to  days after it is shed in a cats feces if you are pregnant or immunocompromised 
     
       avoid changing cat litter if possible if no one else can perform the task wear disposable gloves and wash your hands with soap and warm water afterwards
       keep cats indoors
       do not adopt or handle stray cats especially kittens do not get a new cat while you are pregnant"
exams and tests,how to diagnose parasites  american trypanosomiasis also known as chagas disease ,"the diagnosis of chagas disease can be made by observation of the parasite in a blood smear by microscopic examination a thick and thin blood smear are made and stained for visualization of parasites however a blood smear works well only in the acute phase of infection when parasites are seen circulating in blood
    
diagnosis of chronic chagas disease is made after consideration of the patients clinical findings as well as by the likelihood of being infected such as having lived in an endemic country diagnosis is generally made by testing with at least two different serologic tests"
treatment,what are the treatments for nocardiosis ,"if you think you might be sick with nocardiosis talk to your doctor
    
he or she can help find out if you have the disease by performing tests that can identify the bacteria that causes nocardiosis
    
testing may involve taking tissue samples from the part of the body that is infected tissue samples may include the
    
      brain
      skin
      lungs or other parts of the lower airways
      mucus from the lower airways"
exams and tests,how to diagnose chapare hemorrhagic fever chhf ,"chhf virus has been successfully isolated from both blood and serum during the acute febrile phase of illness although not undertaken at the time of the initial cluster virus can certainly be isolated from tissue obtained postmortem if available a subsequent complete genomic analysis of chapare virus facilitated the development of specific molecular detection rtpcr assays 
   
serologic diagnosis of chhf can be made by indirect immunofluorescent assay and elisa however individuals from endemic areas who show fever dizziness and myalgia accompanied by laboratory findings of low white blood cell and platelet counts and excess protein in the urine should be suspected of having one of the south american hemorrhagic fever viruses clinical specimens should be tested using specific assays"
prevention,how to prevent parasites  lymphatic filariasis ,"the best way to prevent lymphatic filariasis is to avoid mosquito bites the mosquitoes that carry the microscopic worms usually bite between the hours of dusk and dawn if you live in an area with lymphatic filariasis
   
     at night 
     
       sleep in an airconditioned room or
       sleep under a mosquito net
     
     between dusk and dawn 
     
       wear long sleeves and trousers and
       use mosquito repellent on exposed skin
     
   
   
another approach to prevention includes giving entire communities medicine that kills the microscopic worms  and controlling mosquitoes annual mass treatment reduces the level of microfilariae in the blood and thus diminishes transmission of infection this is the basis of the global campaign to eliminate lymphatic filariasis
   
experts consider that lymphatic filariasis a neglected tropical disease ntd can be eradicated and a global campaign to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem is under way the elimination strategy is based on annual treatment of whole communities with combinations of drugs that kill the microfilariae as a result of the generous contributions of these drugs by the companies that make them tens of millions of people are being treated each year since these drugs also reduce levels of infection with intestinal worms benefits of treatment extend beyond lymphatic filariasis successful campaigns to eliminate lymphatic filariasis have taken place in china and other countries

susceptibility,who is at risk for parasites  enterobiasis also known as pinworm infection ,"risk factors
    
the people most likely to be infected with pinworm are children under  people who take care of infected children and people who are institutionalized in these groups the prevalence can reach 
    
pinworm is the most common worm infection in the united states humans are the only species that can transfer this parasite household pets like dogs and cats cannot become infected with human pinworms pinworm eggs can survive in the indoor environment for  to  weeks
    epidemiology
    
pinworm infections are more common within families with schoolaged children in primary caregivers of infected children and in institutionalized children
    
a person is infected with pinworms by ingesting pinworm eggs either directly or indirectly these eggs are deposited around the anus by the worm and can be carried to common surfaces such as hands toys bedding clothing and toilet seats by putting anyone’s contaminated hands including one’s own around the mouth area or putting one’s mouth on common contaminated surfaces a person can ingest pinworm eggs and become infected with the pinworm parasite since pinworm eggs are so small it is possible to ingest them while breathing
    
once someone has ingested pinworm eggs there is an incubation period of  to  months or longer for the adult gravid female to mature in the small intestine once mature the adult female worm migrates to the colon and lays eggs around the anus at night when many of their hosts are asleep people who are infected with pinworm can transfer the parasite to others for as long as there is a female pinworm depositing eggs on the perianal skin a person can also reinfect themselves or be reinfected by eggs from another person"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of rocky mountain spotted fever rmsf ,"the first symptoms of rocky mountain spotted fever rmsf typically begin  days after the bite of an infected tick a tick bite is usually painless and about half of the people who develop rmsf do not remember being bitten the disease frequently begins as a sudden onset of fever and headache and most people visit a healthcare provider during the first few days of symptoms because early symptoms may be nonspecific several visits may occur before the diagnosis of rmsf is made and correct treatment begins the following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease however it is important to note that few people with the disease will develop all symptoms and the number and combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person 
 
  fever  
  rash occurs  days after fever may be absent in some cases see below 
  headache  
  nausea  
  vomiting  
  abdominal pain may mimic appendicitis or other causes of acute abdominal pain  
  muscle pain  
  lack of appetite  
  conjunctival injection red eyes  
 
                
rmsf is a serious illness that can be fatal in the first eight days of symptoms if not treated correctly even in previously healthy people the progression of the disease varies greatly patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics prolonged hospitalization or intensive care 
                
 
rash 
                
while most people with rmsf  have some type of rash during the course of illness some people do not develop the rash until late in the disease process after treatment should have already begun  approximately  of rmsf patients never develop a rash it is important for physicians to consider rmsf if other signs and symptoms support a diagnosis even if a rash is not present 
                
a classic case of rmsf involves a rash that first appears  days after the onset of fever as small flat pink nonitchy spots macules on the wrists forearms and ankles and spreads to include the trunk and sometimes the palms and soles  often the rash varies from this description and people who fail to develop a rash or develop an atypical rash are at increased risk of being misdiagnosed 
                
the red to purple spotted petechial rash of rmsf is usually not seen until the sixth day or later after onset of symptoms and occurs in  of patients with the infection this is a sign of progression to severe disease and every attempt should be made to begin treatment before petechiae develop

longterm health problems 
                
patients who had a particularly severe infection requiring prolonged hospitalization may have longterm health problems caused by this disease rickettsia rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels the damage that occurs in the blood vessels results in a disease process called a vasculitis and bleeding or clotting in the brain or other vital organs may occur loss of fluid from damaged vessels can result in loss of circulation to the extremities and damaged fingers toes or even limbs may ultimately need to be amputated patients who suffer this kind of severe vasculitis in the first two weeks of illness may also be left with permanent longterm health problems such as profound neurological deficits or damage to internal organs those who do not have this kind of vascular damage in the initial stages of the disease typically recover fully within several days to months 
                
 
infection in children 
                
children with rmsf infection may experience nausea vomiting and loss of appetite children are less likely to report a headache but more likely to develop an early rash than adults other frequently observed signs and symptoms in children with rmsf are abdominal pain altered mental status and conjunctival injection occasionally symptoms like cough sore throat and diarrhea may be seen and can lead to misdiagnosis

physician diagnosis 
                
there are several aspects of rmsf that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat the symptoms of rmsf vary from patient to patient and can easily resemble other more common diseases treatment for this disease is most effective at preventing death if started in the first five days of symptoms diagnostic tests for this disease especially tests based on the detection of antibodies will frequently appear negative in the first  days of illness due to the complexities of this disease and the limitations of currently available diagnostic tests there is no test available at this time that can provide a conclusive result in time to make important decisions about treatment 
                
for this reason healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone healthcare providers may find important information in the patient’s history and physical examination that may aid clinical suspicion information such as recent tick bites exposure to high grass and tickinfested areas contact with dogs similar illnesses in family members or pets or history of recent travel to areas of high incidence can be helpful in making the diagnosis also information about the presence of symptoms such as fever and rash may be helpful the healthcare provider may also look at routine blood tests such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel clues such as a low platelet count thrombocytopenia low sodium levels hyponatremia or elevated liver enzyme levels are often helpful predictors of rmsf but may not be present in all patients after a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of rmsf 
  
  
   
  
 
                
 
laboratory confirmation 
                
r rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line blood vessels and does not circulate in large numbers in the blood unless the patient has progressed to a very severe phase of infection for this reason blood specimens whole blood serum are not always useful for detection of the organism through polymerase chain reaction pcr or culture if the patient has a rash pcr or immunohistochemical ihc staining can be performed on a skin biopsy taken from the rash site this test can often deliver a rapid result these tests have good sensitivity  when applied to tissue specimens collected during the acute phase of illness and before antibiotic treatment has been started but a negative result should not be used to guide treatment decisions pcr culture and ihc can also be applied to autopsy specimens liver spleen kidney etc collected after a patient dies culture of r rickettsii is only available at specialized laboratories routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect r rickettsii 
                
during rmsf infection a patient’s immune system develops antibodies to r rickettsii with detectable antibody titers usually observed by  days after illness onset it is important to note that antibodies are not detectable in the first week of illness in  of patients and a negative test during this time does not rule out rmsf as a cause of illness 
                
the gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of rmsf is the indirect immunofluorescence assay ifa with r rickettsii antigen performed on two paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant fourfold rise in antibody titers the first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible preferably in the first week of symptoms and the second sample should be taken  to  weeks later in most rmsf cases the first igg ifa titer is typically low or negative and the second typically shows a significant fourfold increase in igg antibody levels igm antibodies usually rise at the same time as igg near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or even years also igm antibodies are less specific than igg antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive for these reasons physicians requesting igm serologic titers should also request a concurrent igg titer 
                
both igm and igg levels may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms up to  of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to r rickettsii or similar organisms therefore if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret whereas two paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant fourfold rise in antibody titer provide the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of rmsf for more indepth information about testing please visit  
                
 
treatment 
                
doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever rmsf is suspected  
                
use of antibiotics other than doxycycline is associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome treatment is most effective at preventing death if doxycycline is started in the first  days of symptoms therefore treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return or symptoms of severe disease such as petechiae develop 
                
if the patient is treated within the first  days of the disease fever generally subsides within  hours in fact failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient’s condition might not be rmsf severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves especially if they have experienced damage to multiple organ systems resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course of treatment have not been documented 
                
recommended dosage
doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages 
 
  adults  mg every  hours 
  children under  kg  lbs  mgkg body weight given twice a day 
 
                
patients should be treated for at least  days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement standard duration of treatment is  days

the use of doxycycline to treat suspected rmsf in children is standard practice recommended by both cdc and the aap committee on infectious diseases use of antibiotics other than doxycycline increases the risk of patient death unlike older tetracyclines the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat rmsf has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth even when five courses are given before the age of eight healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the firstline treatment for suspected rocky mountain spotted fever in patients of all ages 
other treatments 
                
in cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of rmsf appears mild chloramphenicol may be considered as an alternative antibiotic oral forumulations of chloramphenicol are not available in the united states and use of this drug carries the potential for other adverse risks such as aplastic anemia and grey baby syndrome furthermore the risk for fatal outcome is elevated in patients who are treated with chloramphenicol compared to those treated with doxycycline other antibiotics including broad spectrum antibiotics are not effective against r rickettsii and the use of sulfa drugs may worsen infection 
prophylaxis preventive treatment 
                
antibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent rmsf there is no evidence this practice is effective and may simply delay onset of disease instead persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever rash or other symptoms of concern develop

prevention,how to prevent parasites  fascioliasis fasciola infection ,"no vaccine is available to protect people against fasciola infection
    
in some areas of the world where fascioliasis is found endemic special control programs are in place or are planned the types of control measures depend on the setting such as epidemiologic ecologic and cultural factors strict control of the growth and sale of watercress and other edible water plants is important
    
individual people can protect themselves by not eating raw watercress and other water plants especially from endemic grazing areas as always travelers to areas with poor sanitation should avoid food and water that might be contaminated tainted vegetables grown in fields that might have been irrigated with polluted water should be thoroughly cooked as should viscera from potentially infected animals"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of anaplasmosis ,"anaplasmosis is a disease caused by the bacterium anaplasma phagocytophilium this pathogen is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick the blacklegged tick ixodes scapularis is the vector of a phagocytophilum in the northeast and upper midwestern united states the western blacklegged tick ixodes pacificus is the primary vector in northern california the first symptoms of anaplasmosis typically begin within  weeks after the bite of an infected tick a tick bite is usually painless and some patients who develop anaplasmosis do not remember being bitten the following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease however it is important to note that few people with the disease will develop all symptoms and the number and combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person 
  
   fever 
   headache 
   muscle pain 
   malaise 
   chills 
   nausea  abdominal pain 
   cough 
   confusion 
   rash rare with anaplasmosis 
  
 
anaplasmosis can be a serious illness that can be fatal if not treated correctly even in previously healthy people  severe clinical presentations may include difficulty breathing hemorrhage renal failure or neurological problems the estimated case fatality rate ie the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection is less than  patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics prolonged hospitalization or intensive care 
 
 
 rash 
 
rash is rarely reported in patients with anaplasmosis and the presence of a rash may signify that the patient has a coinfection with the pathogen that causes lyme disease or another tickborne disease such as rocky mountain spotted fever  
 
 
 immunecompromised individuals 
 
the severity of anaplasmosis may depend in part on the immune status of the patient persons with compromised immunity caused by immunosuppressive therapies eg corticosteroids cancer chemotherapy or longterm immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplant hiv infection or splenectomy appear to develop more severe disease and casefatality rates for these individuals are characteristically higher than casefatality rates reported for the general population 
 
 
 blood transfusion and organ transplant risks associated with anaplasma species 
 
because a phagocytophilum infects the white blood cells and circulates in the blood stream this pathogen may pose a risk to be transmitted through blood transfusions anaplasma phagocytophilum has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood several cases of anaplasmosis have been reported associated with the transfusion of packed red blood cells donated from asymptomatic or acutely infected donors patients who develop anaplasmosis within a month of receiving a blood transfusion or solid organ transplant should be reported to state health officials for prompt investigation use of leukoreduced blood products may theoretically decrease the risk of transfusionassociated transmission of these pathogens  however the filtration process does not remove all leukocytes or bacteria not associated with leukocytes from leukoreduced blood therefore while this process may reduce the risk of transmission it does not eliminate it completely 
 
 
 physician diagnosis 
 
there are several aspects of anaplasmosis that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat  the symptoms vary from patient to patient and can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases  treatment is more likely to be effective if started early in the course of disease diagnostic tests based on the detection of antibodies will frequently appear negative in the first  days of illness 
 
for this reason healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone healthcare providers may find important information in the patient’s history and physical examination that may aid clinical diagnosis information such as recent tick bites exposure to areas where ticks are likely to be found or history of recent travel to areas where anaplasmosis is endemic can be helpful in making the diagnosis  the healthcare provider should also look at routine blood tests such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel clues such as a low platelet count thrombocytopenia low white blood cell count leukopenia or elevated liver enzyme levels are helpful predictors of anaplasmosis but may not be present in all patients   after a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of anaplasmosis 
   
   
    
   
  
 
 
 laboratory detection 
 
during the acute phase of illness a sample of whole blood can be tested by polymerase chain reaction pcr assay to determine if a patient has anaplasmosis this method is most sensitive in the first week of illness and rapidly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics although a positive pcr result is helpful a negative result does not completely rule out the diagnosis and treatment should not be with held due to a negative result 
 
during the first week of illness a microscopic examination of blood smears known as a peripheral blood smear may reveal morulae microcolonies of anaplasma in the cytoplasm of white blood cells in up to  of patients  during a phagocytophilum infection morulae are most frequently observed in granulocytes however the observance of morulae in a particular cell type cannot conclusively identify the infecting species culture isolation of a phagocytophilum is only available at specialized laboratories routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect the organism 
 figure  morulae detected in a granulocyte on a peripheral blood smear associated with a phagocytophilum infection 
  
   
     
    
   
  
 
when a person develops anaplasmosis their immune system produces antibodies to a phagocytophilum with detectable antibody titers usually observed by  days after illness onset  it is important to note that a negative test during the first week of illness does not rule out anaplasmosis as a cause of illness  
 
the gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of anaplasmosis is the indirect immunofluorescence assay ifa using a phagocytophilum antigen performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant fourfold rise in antibody titers  the first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible preferably in the first week of symptoms and the second sample should be taken  to  weeks later in most cases of anaplasmosis the first igg ifa titer is typically low or “negative” and the second typically shows a significant fourfold increase in igg antibody levels igm antibodies usually rise at the same time as igg near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or longer  also igm antibodies are less specific than igg antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive  for these reasons physicians requesting igm serologic titers should also request a concurrent igg titer 
 
serologic tests based on enzyme immunoassay eia technology are available from some commercial laboratories however eia tests are qualitative rather than quantitative meaning they only provide a positivenegative result and are less useful to measure changes in antibody titers between paired specimens furthermore some eia assays rely on the evaluation of igm antibody alone which may have a higher frequency of false positive results 
 
antibodies to a phagocytophilum may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms  between  of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to a phagocytophilum or similar organisms therefore if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret while paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant fourfold rise in antibody titer provides the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of anaplasmosis

 treatment 
 
doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever anaplasmosis is suspected  
 
use of antibiotics other than doxycycline or other tetracyclines has been associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome for some rickettsial infections doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications from developing if it is started early in the course of disease therefore treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return 
 
if the patient is treated within the first  days of the disease fever generally subsides within  hours  in fact failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient’s condition might not be due to anaplasmosis severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course have not been documented  
 
recommended dosage
doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages 
  
   adults  mg every  hours 
   children under  kg  lbs  mgkg body weight given twice a day 
  
 
patients should be treated for at least  days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement standard duration of treatment is  to  days some patients may continue to experience headache weakness and malaise for weeks after adequate treatment 
 treating children 
 
the use of doxycycline to treat suspected anaplasmosis in children is standard practice recommended by both cdc and the aap committee on infectious diseases unlike older generations of tetracyclines the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat anaplasmosis has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth even when five courses are given before the age of eight  healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the firstline treatment for suspected anaplasmosis in patients of all ages  
 other treatments 
 
in cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of anaplasmosis appears mild physicians may need to consider alternate antibiotics although recommended as a secondline therapeutic alternative to treat rocky mountain spotted fever  chloramphenicol is not recommended for the treatment of anaplasmosis as studies have shown a lack of efficacy rifampin has been used successfully in several pregnant women with anaplasmosis and studies suggest that this drug appears effective against anaplasma species however rifampin is not effective in treating rmsf a disease that may be confused with anaplasmosis healthcare providers should be cautious when exploring treatments other than doxycycline which is highly effective in treating both other antibiotics including broad spectrum antibiotics are not considered highly effective against a phagocytophilum and the use of sulfa drugs during acute illness may worsen the severity of infection  
 prophylaxis preventive treatment 
 
antibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent anaplasmosis there is no evidence this practice is effective and this may simply delay onset of disease instead persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever rash or other symptoms of concern develop

susceptibility,who is at risk for parasites  cyclosporiasis cyclospora infection ,"people become infected with cyclospora by ingesting sporulated oocysts which are the infective form of the parasite this most commonly occurs when food or water contaminated with feces is consumed an infected person sheds unsporulated immature noninfective cyclospora oocysts in the feces the oocysts are thought to require days to weeks in favorable environmental conditions to sporulate become infective therefore direct persontoperson transmission is unlikely as is transmission via ingestion of newly contaminated food or water
    
more on cyclospora biology
    geographic distribution
    
cyclosporiasis occurs in many countries but it seems to be most common in tropical and subtropical regions in areas where cyclosporiasis has been studied the risk for infection is seasonal however no consistent pattern has been identified regarding the time of year or the environmental conditions such as temperature or rainfall
    
in the united states foodborne outbreaks of cyclosporiasis since the  have been linked to various types of imported fresh produce including raspberries basil snow peas and mesclun lettuce no commercially frozen or canned produce has been implicated
    
us cases of infection also have occurred in persons who traveled to cyclosporaendemic areas to reduce the risk for infection travelers should take precautions such as those recommended in cdcs health information for international travel yellow book travelers also should be aware that treatment of water or food with chlorine or iodine is unlikely to kill cyclospora oocysts"

worldwide an estimated  cases of trichinellosis occur every year several different species of trichinella can cause human disease the most common species is trichinella spiralis which has a global distribution and is the species most commonly found in pigs other trichinella species are less commonly reported as the cause of human disease and may be found in different parts of the world usually infecting wild animals
in the united states trichinellosis cases are reported to cdc much less commonly now than in the past figure  during the late  when the us public health service began counting cases of trichinellosis  cases in the united states were recorded each year on average during   cases were reported to cdc each year on average the overall number of cases reported has decreased because of improved pigraising practices in the pork industry commercial and home freezing of pork and public awareness of the danger of eating raw or undercooked meat products the number of cases associated with raw or undercooked wild game meats has remained relatively constant over time figure  over the past  years few cases of trichinellosis have been reported in the united states and the risk of trichinellosis from commercially raised and properly prepared pork is very low however eating undercooked wild game particularly bear meat puts one at risk for acquiring this disease"

information,what is are tuberous sclerosis ,tuberous sclerosis tsc is a rare genetic disease that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys heart eyes lungs and skin it usually affects the central nervous system in addition to the benign tumors that frequently occur in tsc other common symptoms include seizuresimpaired intellectual development behavior problems and skin abnormalities tsc may be present at birth but signs of the disorder can be subtle and full symptoms may take some time to develop three types of brain tumors are associated with tsc cortical tubers which generally form on the surface of the brain subependymal nodules which form in the walls of the ventricles the fluidfilled cavities of the brain and giantcell astrocytomas a type of tumor that can block the flow of fluids within the brain
treatment,what are the treatments for tuberous sclerosis ,there is no cure for tsc although treatment is available for a number of the symptoms rapamycin and related drugs are not yet approved by the us food and drug administration fda for any purpose in individuals with tsc the fda has approved the drug everolimus afinitor to treat subependymal giant cell astrocytomas sega brain tumors and angiomyolipoma kidney tumors antiepileptic drugs such as vigabatrin may be used to control seizures and medications may be prescribed for behavior problems intervention programs including special schooling and occupational therapy may benefit individuals with special needs and developmental issues surgery including dermabrasion and laser treatment may be useful for treatment of skin lesions because tsc is a lifelong condition individuals need to be regularly monitored by a doctor due to the many varied symptoms of tsc care by a clinician experienced with the disorder is recommended
outlook,what is the outlook for tuberous sclerosis ,the prognosis for individuals with tsc depends on the severity of symptoms individuals with mild symptoms generally do well and live long productive lives while individuals with the more severe form may have serious disabilities in rare cases seizures infections or tumors in vital organs such as the kidneys and brain can lead to severe complications and even death however with appropriate medical care most individuals with the disorder can look forward to normal life expectancy
information,what is are batten disease ,batten disease is a fatal inherited disorder of the nervous system that begins in childhood in some cases the early signs are subtle taking the form of personality and behavior changes slow learning clumsiness or stumbling symptoms of batten disease are linked to a buildup of substances called lipopigments in the bodys tissues lipopigments are made up of fats and proteins because vision loss is often an early sign batten disease may be first suspected during an eye exam often an eye specialist or other physician may refer the child to a neurologist diagnostic tests for batten disease include blood or urine tests skin or tissue sampling an electroencephalogram eeg electrical studies of the eyes and brain scans

information,what is are giant axonal neuropathy ,"giant axonal neuropathy gan is a rare inherited genetic disorder that affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems the majority of children with gan will begin to show symptoms of the disease sometime before five years of age signs of gan usually begin in the peripheral nervous system which controls movement and sensation in the arms legs and other parts of the body the typical symptoms of gan are clumsiness and muscle weakness that progresses from a waddling gait to a pronounced difficulty in walking additional symptoms include numbness or lack of feeling in the arms and legs seizures nystagmus rapid back and forth movement of the eyes and impaired cognitive development a characteristic sign of the disease is dull tightly curled hair that is markedly different from the parents in color and texture
                
researchers have discovered more than  different mutations associated with gan in a gene  which makes a protein called gigaxonin these mutations disrupt the regulation or production of gigaxonin in the nervous system as a result axons which are the long tails of neurons that allow them to communicate with other nerve cells swell up with tangled filaments and become abnormally large eventually these axons deteriorate and cause problems with movement and sensation since neurons are no longer able to communicate with each other
                
doctors diagnose gan by using several tests including one that measures nerve conduction velocity a brain mri and a peripheral nerve biopsy in which a bit of tissue from a peripheral nerve is removed and examined to look for swollen axons a definitive diagnosis using genetic testing is available on a research basis only
                
gan is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means that both parents of a child with gan have to carry a copy of the mutated gene parents typically will show no signs of the disease"
information,what is are thoracic outlet syndrome ,"tos is an umbrella term that encompasses three related syndromes that involve compression of the nerves arteries and veins in the lower neck and upper chest area and cause pain in the arm shoulder and neck most doctors agree that tos is caused by compression of the brachial plexus or subclavian vessels as they pass through narrow passageways leading from the base of the neck to the armpit and arm but there is considerable disagreement about its diagnosis and treatment making the diagnosis of tos even more difficult is that a number of disorders feature symptoms similar to those of tos including rotator cuff injuries cervical disc disorders fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis complex regional pain syndrome and tumors of the syrinx or spinal cord the disorder can sometimes be diagnosed in a physical exam by tenderness in the supraclavicular area weakness andor a pins and needles feeling when elevating the hands weakness in the fifth little finger and paleness in the palm of one or both hands when the individual raises them above the shoulders with the fingers pointing to the ceiling symptoms of tos vary depending on the type  neurogenic tos has a characteristic sign called the gilliattsumner hand in which there is severe wasting in the fleshy base of the thumb other symptoms include paresthesias pins and needles sensation or numbness in the fingers and hand change in hand color hand coldness or dull aching pain in the neck shoulder and armpit  venous tos features pallor a weak or absent pulse in the affected arm which also may be cool to the touch and appear paler than the unaffected arm symptoms may include numbness tingling aching swelling of the extremity and fingers and weakness of the neck or arm  arterial tos most prominently features change in color and cold sensitivity in the hands and fingers swelling heaviness paresthesias and poor blood circulation in the arms hands and fingers
                
there are many causes of tos including physical trauma anatomical defects tumors that press on nerves poor posture that causes nerve compression pregnancy and repetitive arm and shoulder movements and activity such as from playing certain sports  tos is more common in women the onset of symptoms usually occurs between  and  years of age doctors usually recommend nerve conduction studies electromyography or imaging studies to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of tos"
treatment,what are the treatments for thoracic outlet syndrome ,treatment begins with exercise programs and physical therapy to strengthen chest muscles restore normal posture and relieve compression by increasing the space of the area the nerve passes through doctors will often prescribe nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as naproxen or ibuprofen for pain other medicines include thromobolytics to break up blood clots and anticoagulants to prevent clots if this doesnt relieve pain a doctor may recommend thoracic outlet decompression surgery to release or remove the structures causing compression of the nerve or artery

information,what is are ataxia ,"ataxia often occurs when parts of the nervous system that control movement are damaged people with ataxia experience a failure of muscle control in their arms and legs resulting in a lack of balance and coordination or a disturbance of gait while the term ataxia is primarily used to describe this set of symptoms it is sometimes also used to refer to a family of disorders it is not however a specific diagnosis
                
most disorders that result in ataxia cause cells in the part of the brain called the cerebellum to degenerate or atrophy sometimes the spine is also affected the phrases cerebellar degeneration and spinocerebellar degeneration are used to describe changes that have taken place in a persons nervous system neither term constitutes a specific diagnosis cerebellar and spinocerebellar degeneration have many different causes the age of onset of the resulting ataxia varies depending on the underlying cause of the degeneration
                
many ataxias are hereditary and are classified by chromosomal location and pattern of inheritance autosomal dominant in which the affected person inherits a normal gene from one parent and a faulty gene from the other parent and autosomal recessive in which both parents pass on a copy of the faulty gene among the more common inherited ataxias are friedreichs ataxia and machadojoseph disease sporadic ataxias can also occur in families with no prior history

outlook,what is the outlook for dravet syndrome ,as children with dravet syndrome get older their decline in cognitive function stabilizes and in many it improves slightly however most teenagers with dravet syndrome are dependent on caregivers the degree of cognitive impairment appears to correlate with the frequency of seizures
information,what is are mucolipidoses ,"the mucolipidoses ml are a group of inherited metabolic diseases that affect the bodys ability to carry out the normal turnover of various materials within cells in ml abnormal amounts of carbohydrates and fatty materials lipids accumulate in cells because our cells are not able to handle such large amounts of these substances damage to the cells occurs causing symptoms that range from mild learning disabilities to severe intellectual impairment and skeletal deformities
                
the group includes four diseases
                
 mucolipidosis i sialidosis   mucolipidosis ii inclusioncell or icell disease   mucolipidosis iii pseudohurler polydystrophy   mucolipidosis iv
                
the mls are classified as lysosomal storage diseases because they involve increased storage of substances in the lysosomes which are specialized saclike components within most cells individuals with ml are born with a genetic defect in which their bodies either do not produce enough enzymes or in some instances produce ineffective forms of enzymes without functioning enzymes lysosomes cannot break down carbohydrates and lipids and transport them to their normal destination the molecules then accumulate in the cells of various tissues in the body leading to swelling and damage of organs
                
the mucolipidoses occur only when a child inherits two copies of the defective gene one from each parent when both parents carry a defective gene each of their children faces a one in four chance of developing one of the mls"
research,what research or clinical trials is being done for mucolipidoses ,the mission of the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke ninds is to seek fundamental knowledge of the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease investigators are conducting studies to determine the effects of ml genetic mutations in various animal models of the disease studying the disease mechanisms in these models may allow scientists to develop treatments for people with an ml disorderclinical trials include a natural history of individuals with ml iv to better understand the disease and identify potential outcomes and longitudinal studies to better understand disease progression assess current therapies and identify potential treatments

information,what is are shingles ,shingles herpes zoster is an outbreak of rash or blisters on the skin that is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox  the varicellazoster virus the first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain which can be severe or sometimes numbness or itchgenerally on one side of the body after several days or a week a rash of fluidfilled blisters similar to chickenpox appears in one area on one side of the body shingles pain can be mild or intense some people have mostly itching some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze the most common location for shingles is a band called a dermatome spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles scientists think that some of the virus particles from the original exposure to the varicellazoster virusleave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system when the varicellazoster virus reactivates the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin the viruses multiply the telltale rash erupts and the person now has shingles
information,what is are neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation ,neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation nbia is a rare inherited neurological movement disorder characterized by an abnormal accumulation of iron in the brain and progressive degeneration of the nervous system symptoms which vary greatly among patients and usually develop during childhood may include dystonia slow writhing distorting muscle contractions of the limbs face or trunk dysarthria slurred or slow speech choreoathetosis involuntary purposeless jerky muscle movements muscle rigidity uncontrolled tightness of the muscles spasticity sudden involuntary muscle spasms andor ataxia inability to coordinate movements confusion disorientation seizures stupor and dementia visual changes are also common most often due to atrophy of the optic nerve optic atrophy or degeneration of the retinal layer in the back of the eye retinal degeneration cognitive decline occurs in some forms of nbia the majority of individuals with nbia do not have cognitive impairment several genes have been found that cause nbia
information,what is are huntingtons disease ,huntingtons disease hd is an inherited disorder that causes degeneration of brain cells called neurons in motor control regions of the brain as well as other areas symptoms of the disease which gets progressively worse include uncontrolled movements called chorea abnormal body postures and changes in behavior emotion judgment and cognition people with hd also develop impaired coordination slurred speech and difficulty feeding and swallowing hd typically begins between ages  and  an earlier onset form called juvenile hd occurs under age  symptoms of juvenile hd differ somewhat from adult onset hd and include unsteadiness rigidity difficulty at school and seizures more than  americans have hd  huntingtons disease is caused by a mutation in the gene for a protein called huntingtin the defect causes the cytosine adenine and guanine cag building blocks of dna to repeat many more times than is normal each child of a parent with hd has a  chance of inheriting the hd gene if a child does not inherit the hd gene he or she will not develop the disease and generally cannot pass it to subsequent generations there is a small risk that someone who has a parent with the mutated gene but who did not inherit the hd gene may pass a possibly harmful genetic sequence to herhis children a person who inherits the hd gene will eventually develop the disease a genetic test coupled with a complete medical history and neurological and laboratory tests helps physicians diagnose hd
treatment,what are the treatments for huntingtons disease ,there is no treatment that can stop or reverse the course of hd tetrabenazine is prescribed for treating huntingtonsassociated chorea it is the only drug approved by the us food and drug administration specifically for use against hd antipsychotic drugs may help to alleviate chorea and may also be used to help control hallucinations delusions and violent outbursts drugs may be prescribed to treat depression and anxiety drugs used to treat the symptoms of hd may have side effects such as fatigue sedation decreased concentration restlessness or hyperexcitability and should be only used when symptoms create problems for the individual
outlook,what is the outlook for huntingtons disease ,huntingtons disease causes disability that gets worse over time people with this disease usually die within  to  years following diagnosis at this time no treatment is available to slow stop or reverse the course of hd
information,what is are sleep apnea ,sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by brief interruptions of breathing during sleep these episodes usually last  seconds or more and occur repeatedly throughout the night people with sleep apnea will partially awaken as they struggle to breathe but in the morning they will not be aware of the disturbances in their sleep the most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea osa caused by relaxation of soft tissue in the back of the throat that blocks the passage of air central sleep apnea csa is caused by irregularities in the brains normal signals to breathe most people with sleep apnea will have a combination of both types the hallmark symptom of the disorder is excessive daytime sleepiness additional symptoms of sleep apnea include restless sleep loud snoring with periods of silence followed by gasps falling asleep during the day morning headaches trouble concentrating irritability forgetfulness mood or behavior changes anxiety and depression not everyone who has these symptoms will have sleep apnea but it is recommended that people who are experiencing even a few of these symptoms visit their doctor for evaluation sleep apnea is more likely to occur in men than women and in people who are overweight or obese
information,what is are central pontine myelinolysis ,"central pontine myelinolysis cpm is a neurological disorder that most frequently occurs after too rapid medical correction of sodium deficiency hyponatremia the rapid rise in sodium concentration is accompanied by the movement of small molecules and pulls water from brain cells through a mechanism that is only partly understood the shift in water and brain molecules leads to the destruction of myelin a substance that surrounds and protects nerve fibers nerve cells neurons can also be damaged certain areas of the brain are particularly susceptible to myelinolysis especially the part of the brain stem called the pons some individuals will also have damage in other areas of the brain which is called extrapontine myelinolysis epm experts estimate that  percent of those with cpm will also have areas of epm
                
the initial symptoms of myelinolysis which begin to appear  to  days after hyponatremia is corrected include a depressed level of awareness difficulty speaking dysarthria or mutism and difficulty swallowing dysphagia additional symptoms often arise over the next  weeks including impaired thinking weakness or paralysis in the arms and legs stiffness impaired sensation and difficulty with coordination at its most severe myelinolysis can lead to coma lockedin syndrome which is the complete paralysis of all of the voluntary muscles in the body except for those that control the eyes and death
                
although many affected people improve over weeks to months some have permanent disability some also develop new symptoms later including behavioral or intellectual impairment or movement disorders like parkinsonism or tremor
                
anyone including adults and children who undergoes a rapid rise in serum sodium is at risk for myelinolysis some individuals who are particularly vulnerable are those with chronic alcoholism and those who have had a liver transplant myelinolysis has occurred in individuals undergoing renal dialysis burn victims people with hivaids people overusing water loss pills diuretics and women with eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia the risk for cpm is greater if the serum blood sodium was low for at least  days before correction"
treatment,what are the treatments for attention deficithyperactivity disorder ,the usual course of treatment may include medications such as methylphenidate ritalin or dextroamphetamine dexedrine which are stimulants that decrease impulsivity and hyperactivity and increase attention most experts agree that treatment for adhd should address multiple aspects of the individuals functioning and should not be limited to the use of medications alone treatment should include structured classroom management parent education to address discipline and limitsetting and tutoring andor behavioral therapy for the child
research,what research or clinical trials is being done for attention deficithyperactivity disorder ,several components of the nih support research on developmental disorders such as adhd research programs of the ninds the national institute of mental health nimh and the national institute of child health and human development nichd seek to address unanswered questions about the causes of adhd as well as to improve diagnosis and treatment
information,what is are zellweger syndrome ,"zellweger syndrome is one of a group of four related diseases called peroxisome biogenesis disorders pbd the diseases are caused by defects in any one of  genes termed pex genes required for the normal formation and function of peroxisomes the pbds are divided into two groups zellweger spectrum disorders and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctua spectrum the zellweger spectrum is comprised of three disorders that have considerable overlap of features these include zellweger syndrome zs the most severe form neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy nald and infantile refsum disease ird the least severe form
                
peroxisomes are cell structures that break down toxic substances and synthesize lipids fatty acids oils and waxes that are necessary for cell function peroxisomes are required for normal brain development and function and the formation of myelin the whitish substance that coats nerve fibers they are also required for normal eye liver kidney and bone functions zellweger spectrum disorders result from dysfunctional lipid metabolism including the overaccumulation of very longchain fatty acids and phytanic acid and defects of bile acids and plasmalogensspecialized lipids found in cell membranes and myelin sheaths of nerve fibers symptoms of these disorders include an enlarged liver characteristic facial features such as a high forehead underdeveloped eyebrow ridges and wideset eyes and neurological abnormalities such as cognitive impairment and seizures infants will zellweger syndrome also lack muscle tone sometimes to the point of being unable to move and may not be able to suck or swallow some babies will be born with glaucoma retinal degeneration and impaired hearing jaundice and gastrointestinal bleeding also may occur"
treatment,what are the treatments for zellweger syndrome ,there is no cure for zellweger syndrome nor is there a standard course of treatment since the metabolic and neurological abnormalities that cause the symptoms of zellweger syndrome are caused during fetal development treatments to correct these abnormalities after birth are limited most treatments are symptomatic and supportive
research,what research or clinical trials is being done for coma ,the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke ninds and other institutes of the national institutes of health nih conduct research related to coma in their laboratories at the nih and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent and treat coma
information,what is are creutzfeldtjakob disease ,creutzfeldtjakob disease cjd is a rare degenerativefatal brain disorder typically onset of symptoms occurs at about age  there are three major categories of cjd sporadic the most common form in which people do not have any risk factors for the disease hereditary in which the person has a family member with the disease and tests positive for a genetic mutation and acquired in which the disease is transmitted by exposure to brain and nervous system tissue usually through certain medical procedures a form called variant cjd can be acquired by eating meat from cattle affected by a disease similar to cjd called bovine spongiform encephalopathy commonly called mad cow disease symptoms of cjd include problems with muscular coordination personality changes including progressive and severe mental impairment impaired vision that may lead to blindness and involuntary muscle jerks called myoclonus people eventually lose the ability to move and speak and enter a coma tests that help in the diagnosis of cjd include electroencephalography which measures brain waves detection of certain proteins in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord and magnetic resonance imaging the first concern is to rule out treatable forms of dementia such as encephalitis or chronic meningitis the only way to confirm a diagnosis of cjd is by brain biopsy or autopsy in a brain biopsy a neurosurgeon removes a small piece of tissue from the persons brain so that it can be examined by a neurologist because a correct diagnosis of cjd does not help the individual a brain biopsy is discouraged unless it is need to rule out a treatable disorder 
research,what research or clinical trials is being done for chorea ,the ninds supports research on movement disorders such as chorea the goals of this research are to increase understanding of these disorders and to find ways to prevent and treat them
treatment,what are the treatments for sydenham chorea ,there is no specific treatment for sd for people with the mildest form bed rest during the period of active movements is sufficient when the severity of movements interferes with rest sedative drugs such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines may be needed antiepileptic medications such as valproic acid are often prescribed doctors also recommend that children who have had sd take penicillin over the course of the next  years to prevent additional manifestations of rheumatic fever
research,what research or clinical trials is being done for sydenham chorea ,the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke ninds and other institutes of the national institutes of health nih conduct research related to sd in laboratories at the nih and support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country currently researchers are studying how the interplay of genetic developmental and environmental factors could determine a childs vulnerability to sd after a gabhs infection other researchers are exploring whether children whose symptoms either begin or get worse following a gabhs infection share a common set of abnormal biomolecular pathways responsible for their similar clinical symptoms
information,what is are lactose intolerance ,lactose is a sugar found in milk and milk products the small intestinethe organ where most food digestion and nutrient absorption take placeproduces an enzyme called lactase lactase breaks down lactose into two simpler forms of sugar glucose and galactose the body then absorbs these simpler sugars into the bloodstream
symptoms,what are the symptoms of lactose intolerance ,"common symptoms of lactose intolerance include
                
 abdominal bloating a feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen   abdominal pain   diarrhea   gas   nausea
                
symptoms occur  minutes to  hours after consuming milk or milk products symptoms range from mild to severe based on the amount of lactose the person ate or drank and the amount a person can tolerate"
considerations,what to do for lactose intolerance ,"people may find it helpful to talk with a health care provider or a registered dietitian about a dietary plan a dietary plan can help people manage the symptoms of lactose intolerance and make sure they get enough nutrients parents caretakers childcare providers and others who serve food to children with lactose intolerance should follow the dietary plan recommended by the childs health care provider or registered dietitian
                
milk and milk products gradually introducing small amounts of milk or milk products may help some people adapt to them with fewer symptoms often people can better tolerate milk or milk products by having them with meals such as having milk with cereal or having cheese with crackers people with lactose intolerance are generally more likely to tolerate hard cheeses such as cheddar or swiss than a glass of milk a  serving of lowfat hard cheese has less than  gram of lactose while a  serving of lowfat milk has about  to  grams of 
                
however people with lactose intolerance are also more likely to tolerate yogurt than milk even though yogurt and milk have similar amounts of 
                
lactosefree and lactosereduced milk and milk products lactosefree and lactosereduced milk and milk products are available at most supermarkets and are identical nutritionally to regular milk and milk products manufacturers treat lactosefree milk with the lactase enzyme this enzyme breaks down the lactose in the milk lactosefree milk remains fresh for about the same length of time or if it is ultrapasteurized longer than regular milk lactosefree milk may have a slightly sweeter taste than regular milk
                
lactase products people can use lactase tablets and drops when they eat or drink milk products the lactase enzyme digests the lactose in the food and therefore reduces the chances of developing digestive symptoms people should check with a health care provider before using these products because some groups such as young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women may not be able to use them"
considerations,what to do for what i need to know about crohns disease ,"your health care provider may start you on a special diet so you get extra nutrition and calories highcalorie liquid supplements are often used to give you the extra calories and right amount of vitamins and minerals to keep you healthy during acute phases of the disease you may need to receive intravenous nutrition to give the intestine a rest
                
no foods are known to cause injury or inflammation to the intestine but foods such as hot spices alcohol greasy foods and milk products may make diarrhea and cramping worse you should eat a healthy diet and avoid foods that make symptoms worse your health care provider may refer you to a dietitian to help you with meal planning"
information,what is are smoking and the digestive system ,the digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal gi tractalso called the digestive tractand the liver pancreas and gallbladder the gi tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long twisting tube from the mouth to the anus the hollow organs that make up the gi tract are the mouth esophagus stomach small intestine large intestinewhich includes the colon and rectumand anus food enters the mouth and passes to the anus through the hollow organs of the gi tract the liver pancreas and gallbladder are the solid organs of the digestive system the digestive system helps the body digest food which includes breaking food down into nutrients the body needs nutrients are substances the body uses for energy growth and cell repair
treatment,what are the treatments for hypoglycemia ,"signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia vary from person to person people with diabetes should get to know their signs and symptoms and describe them to their friends and family so they can help if needed school staff should be told how to recognize a childs signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and how to treat it
                
people who experience hypoglycemia several times in a week should call their health care provider they may need a change in their treatment plan less medication or a different medication a new schedule for insulin or medication a different meal plan or a new physical activity plan
                
prompt treatment for hypoglycemia
                
when people think their blood glucose is too low they should check the blood glucose level of a blood sample using a meter if the level is below  mgdl one of these quickfix foods should be consumed right away to raise blood glucose
                
  or  glucose tablets    serving of glucose gelthe amount equal to  grams of carbohydrate    cup or  ounces of any fruit juice    cup or  ounces of a regularnot dietsoft drink    cup or  ounces of milk    or  pieces of hard candy    tablespoon of sugar or honey
                
recommended amounts may be less for small children the childs doctor can advise about the right amount to give a child
                
the next step is to recheck blood glucose in  minutes to make sure it is  mgdl or above if its still too low another serving of a quickfix food should be eaten these steps should be repeated until the blood glucose level is  mgdl or above if the next meal is an hour or more away a snack should be eaten once the quickfix foods have raised the blood glucose level to  mgdl or above
                
for people who take acarbose precose or miglitol glyset
                
people who take either of these diabetes medications should know that only pure glucose also called dextroseavailable in tablet or gel formwill raise their blood glucose level during a low blood glucose episode other quickfix foods and drinks wont raise the level quickly enough because acarbose and miglitol slow the digestion of other forms of carbohydrate
                
help from others for severe hypoglycemia
                
severe hypoglycemiavery low blood glucosecan cause a person to pass out and can even be life threatening severe hypoglycemia is more likely to occur in people with type  diabetes people should ask a health care provider what to do about severe hypoglycemia another person can help someone who has passed out by giving an injection of glucagon glucagon will rapidly bring the blood glucose level back to normal and help the person regain consciousness a health care provider can prescribe a glucagon emergency kit family friends or coworkersthe people who will be around the person at risk of hypoglycemiacan learn how to give a glucagon injection and when to call  or get medical help
                
physical activity and blood glucose levels
                
physical activity has many benefits for people with diabetes including lowering blood glucose levels however physical activity can make levels too low and can cause hypoglycemia up to  hours afterward a health care provider can advise about checking the blood glucose level before exercise for those who take insulin or one of the oral medications that increase insulin production the health care provider may suggest having a snack if the glucose level is below  mgdl or adjusting medication doses before physical activity to help avoid hypoglycemia a snack can prevent hypoglycemia the health care provider may suggest extra blood glucose checks especially after strenuous exercise
                
hypoglycemia when driving
                
hypoglycemia is particularly dangerous if it happens to someone who is driving people with hypoglycemia may have trouble concentrating or seeing clearly behind the wheel and may not be able to react quickly to road hazards or to the actions of other drivers to prevent problems people at risk for hypoglycemia should check their blood glucose level before driving during longer trips they should check their blood glucose level frequently and eat snacks as needed to keep the level at  mgdl or above if necessary they should stop for treatment and then make sure their blood glucose level is  mgdl or above before starting to drive again
                
hypoglycemia unawareness
                
some people with diabetes do not have early warning signs of low blood glucose a condition called hypoglycemia unawareness this condition occurs most often in people with type  diabetes but it can also occur in people with type  diabetes people with hypoglycemia unawareness may need to check their blood glucose level more often so they know when hypoglycemia is about to occur they also may need a change in their medications meal plan or physical activity routine
                
hypoglycemia unawareness develops when frequent episodes of hypoglycemia lead to changes in how the body reacts to low blood glucose levels the body stops releasing the hormone epinephrine and other stress hormones when blood glucose drops too low the loss of the bodys ability to release stress hormones after repeated episodes of hypoglycemia is called hypoglycemiaassociated autonomic failure or haaf
                
epinephrine causes early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia such as shakiness sweating anxiety and hunger without the release of epinephrine and the symptoms it causes a person may not realize that hypoglycemia is occurring and may not take action to treat it a vicious cycle can occur in which frequent hypoglycemia leads to hypoglycemia unawareness and haaf which in turn leads to even more severe and dangerous hypoglycemia studies have shown that preventing hypoglycemia for a period as short as several weeks can sometimes break this cycle and restore awareness of symptoms health care providers may therefore advise people who have had severe hypoglycemia to aim for higherthanusual blood glucose targets for shortterm periods
                
being prepared for hypoglycemia
                
people who use insulin or take an oral diabetes medication that can cause low blood glucose should always be prepared to prevent and treat low blood glucose by
                
 learning what can trigger low blood glucose levels   having their blood glucose meter available to test glucose levels frequent testing may be critical for those with hypoglycemia unawareness particularly before driving a car or engaging in any hazardous activity   always having several servings of quickfix foods or drinks handy   wearing a medical identification bracelet or necklace   planning what to do if they develop severe hypoglycemia   telling their family friends and coworkers about the symptoms of hypoglycemia and how they can help if needed
                
normal and target blood glucose ranges          normal blood glucose levels in people who do not have diabetes          upon wakingfasting     to  mgdl        after meals     to  mgdl          target blood glucose levels in people who have diabetes          before meals     to  mgdl         to  hours after the start of a meal    below  mgdl
                
for people with diabetes a blood glucose level below  mgdl is considered hypoglycemia"
causes,what causes kidney stones in adults ,"kidney stones can form when substances in the urinesuch as calcium oxalate and phosphorusbecome highly concentrated certain foods may promote stone formation in people who are susceptible but scientists do not believe that eating any specific food causes stones to form in people who are not susceptible people who do not drink enough fluids may also be at higher risk as their urine is more concentrated
                
people who are at increased risk of kidney stones are those with

treatment,what are the treatments for kidney stones in adults ,"treatment for kidney stones usually depends on their size and what they are made of as well as whether they are causing pain or obstructing the urinary tract kidney stones may be treated by a general practitioner or by a urologista doctor who specializes in the urinary tract small stones usually pass through the urinary tract without treatment still the person may need pain medication and should drink lots of fluids to help move the stone along pain control may consist of oral or intravenous iv medication depending on the duration and severity of the pain iv fluids may be needed if the person becomes dehydrated from vomiting or an inability to drink a person with a larger stone or one that blocks urine flow and causes great pain may need more urgent treatment such as
                
 shock wave lithotripsy a machine called a lithotripter is used to crush the kidney stone the procedure is performed by a urologist on an outpatient basis and anesthesia is used in shock wave lithotripsy the person lies on a table or less commonly in a tub of water above the lithotripter the lithotripter generates shock waves that pass through the persons body to break the kidney stone into smaller pieces to pass more readily through the urinary tract   ureteroscopy a ureteroscopea long tubelike instrument with an eyepieceis used to find and retrieve the stone with a small basket or to break the stone up with laser energy the procedure is performed by a urologist in a hospital with anesthesia the urologist inserts the ureteroscope into the persons urethra and slides the scope through the bladder and into the ureter the urologist removes the stone or if the stone is large uses a flexible fiber attached to a laser generator to break the stone into smaller pieces that can pass out of the body in the urine the person usually goes home the same day
                
 percutaneous nephrolithotomy in this procedure a wirethin viewing instrument called a nephroscope is used to locate and remove the stone the procedure is performed by a urologist in a hospital with anesthesia during the procedure a tube is inserted directly into the kidney through a small incision in the persons back for large stones an ultrasonic probe that acts as a lithotripter may be needed to deliver shock waves that break the stone into small pieces that can be removed more easily the person may have to stay in the hospital for several days after the procedure and may have a small tube called a nephrostomy tube inserted through the skin into the kidney the nephrostomy tube drains urine and any residual stone fragments from the kidney into a urine collection bag the tube is usually left in the kidney for  or  days while the person remains in the hospital"
complications,what are the complications of anemia in chronic kidney disease ,"heart problems are a complication of anemia and may include
                
 an irregular heartbeat or an unusually fast heartbeat especially when exercising   the harmful enlargement of muscles in the heart   heart failure which does not mean the heart suddenly stops working instead heart failure is a longlasting condition in which the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs"
treatment,what are the treatments for anemia in chronic kidney disease ,"depending on the cause a health care provider treats anemia with one or more of the following treatments
                
iron
                
the first step in treating anemia is raising low iron levels iron pills may help improve iron and hemoglobin levels however for patients on hemodialysis many studies show pills do not work as well as iron given 
                
erythropoietin
                
if blood tests indicate kidney disease as the most likely cause of anemia treatment can include injections of a genetically engineered form of epo a health care provider often a nurse injects the patient with epo subcutaneously or under the skin as needed some patients learn how to inject the epo themselves patients on hemodialysis may receive epo intravenously during hemodialysis
                
studies have shown the use of epo increases the chance of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke in people with ckd the health care provider will carefully review the medical history of the patient and determine if epo is the best treatment for the patients anemia experts recommend using the lowest dose of epo that will reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions additionally health care providers should consider the use of epo only when a patients hemoglobin level is below  gdl health care providers should not use epo to maintain a patients hemoglobin level above   patients who receive epo should have regular blood tests to monitor their hemoglobin so the health care provider can adjust the epo dose when the level is too high or too  health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of epo with their patients
                
many people with kidney disease need iron supplements and epo to raise their red blood cell count to a level that will reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions in some people iron supplements and epo will improve the symptoms of anemia
                
red blood cell transfusions
                
if a patients hemoglobin falls too low a health care provider may prescribe a red blood cell transfusion transfusing red blood cells into the patients vein raises the percentage of the patients blood that consists of red blood cells increasing the amount of oxygen available to the body
                
vitamin  and folic acid supplements
                
a health care provider may suggest vitamin  and folic acid supplements for some people with ckd and anemia using vitamin supplements can treat low levels of vitamin  or folic acid and help treat anemia to help ensure coordinated and safe care people should discuss their use of complementary and alternative medical practices including their use of dietary supplements with their health care provider

considerations,what to do for anemia in chronic kidney disease ,"a health care provider may advise people with kidney disease who have anemia caused by iron vitamin  or folic acid deficiencies to include sources of these nutrients in their diets some of these foods are high in sodium or phosphorus which people with ckd should limit in their diet before making any dietary changes people with ckd should talk with their health care provider or with a dietitian who specializes in helping people with kidney disease a dietitian can help a person plan healthy meals
                
read more about nutrition for people with ckd on the national kidney disease education program website
                
the following chart illustrates some good dietary sources of iron vitamin  and folic acid
                
food    serving size    iron    vitamin     folic acid          recommended daily value         mg     mcg     mcg         percent fortified breakfast cereal     cup  oz     mg     mcg     mcg        beans baked     cup  oz     mg     mcg     mcg        beef ground     oz     mg     mcg     mcg        beef liver     oz     mg     mcg     mcg        clams fried     oz     mg     mcg     mcg        spinach boiled     cup  oz     mg     mcg     mcg        spinach fresh     cup  oz     mg     mcg     mcg        trout     oz     mg     mcg     mcg        tuna canned     oz     mg     mcg     mcg"

frequency,how many people are affected by celiac disease ,"as many as one in  americans has celiac disease although most remain  celiac disease affects children and adults in all parts of the world and is more common in caucasians and females
                
celiac disease is also more common among people with certain genetic diseases including down syndrome and turner syndromea condition that affects girls development"
treatment,what are the treatments for celiac disease ,"most people with celiac disease have a significant improvement in symptoms when they follow a glutenfree diet health care providers typically refer people to a dietitian who specializes in treating people with the disease the dietitian will teach the person to avoid gluten while following a healthy and nutritious diet the dietitian will give the person instructions for how to
                
 read food and product labels and identify ingredients that contain gluten   make healthy choices about the types of foods to eat   design everyday meal plans
                
for most people following a glutenfree diet will stop symptoms heal existing intestinal damage and prevent further damage symptoms may improve within days to weeks of starting the diet the small intestine usually heals in  to  months in children complete healing can take several years in adults once the intestine heals the villi will absorb nutrients from food into the bloodstream normally
                
some people with celiac disease show no improvement after starting a glutenfree diet the most common reason for poor response to dietary changes is that people are still consuming small amounts of gluten which can damage the small intestineeven in people without symptoms most people start responding to the glutenfree diet once they find and eliminate hidden sources of gluten from their diet hidden sources of gluten include additives made with wheat such as
                
 modified food starch   preservatives   stabilizers
                

                
did you know that medications and nonfood products may contain gluten   medications supplements and other products may also contain lecithin a hidden source of gluten people with celiac disease should ask a pharmacist about the ingredients in    prescription and overthecounter medications    vitamins and mineral supplements    herbal and nutritional supplements    other products can be ingested or transferred from a persons hands to his or her mouth reading product labels can help people avoid gluten exposure if a products label does not list its ingredients the manufacturer should provide a list upon request   products that can contain gluten include    lipstick lip gloss and lip balm    cosmetics    skin and hair products    toothpaste and mouthwash    glue on stamps and envelopes    childrens modeling dough such as playdoh
                
some people who continue to have symptoms even after changing their diet may have other conditions or disorders that are more common in people with celiac disease these conditions may include
                
 small intestinal bacterial overgrowth which happens when too many bacteria grow in the small intestine   pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in which the pancreas does not produce enough digestive juice   microscopic colitis an inflammation of the colon that a health care provider can see only with a microscope   ibs   lactose intolerance a condition in which people have symptoms after consuming milk or milk products   other food intolerances which may occur because of continued damage to the intestine
                
in some cases people continue to have difficulty absorbing nutrients despite following a strict glutenfree diet people with this condition known as refractory celiac disease have severely damaged intestines that cannot heal their intestines are not absorbing enough nutrients so they may need to receive nutrients intravenously researchers continue to evaluate medications to treat refractory celiac disease
                
depending on a persons age at diagnosis some complications of celiac disease will not improve such as short stature and dental enamel defects
                
for people with dermatitis herpetiformis skin symptoms generally respond to a glutenfree diet and may recur if a person adds gluten back into his or her diet medications such as dapsone can control the rashs symptoms dapsone does not treat intestinal symptoms or damage so people with dermatitis herpetiformis should maintain a glutenfree diet even if they dont have digestive symptoms even when a person follows a glutenfree diet the skin lesions from dermatitis herpetiformis may take months or even years to fully heal and often recur over the years"

exams and tests,how to diagnose mntriers disease ,"health care providers base the diagnosis of mntriers disease on a combination of symptoms lab findings findings on upper gastrointestinal gi endoscopy and stomach biopsy results a health care provider will begin the diagnosis of mntriers disease by taking a patients medical and family history and performing a physical exam however a health care provider will confirm the diagnosis of mntriers disease through a computerized tomography ct scan an upper gi endoscopy and a biopsy of stomach tissue a health care provider also may order blood tests to check for infection with h pylori or cmv
                
medical and family history taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose mntriers disease he or she will ask the patient to provide a medical and family history
                
physical exam a physical exam may help diagnose mntriers disease during a physical exam a health care provider usually
                
 examines a patients body   uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds   taps on specific areas of the patients body
                
ct scan ct scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images for a ct scan a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye called contrast medium ct scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnelshaped device where an xray technician takes x rays an xray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets them the patient does not need anesthesia ct scans can show enlarged folds in the stomach wall
                
upper gi endoscopy this procedure involves using an endoscopea small flexible tube with a lightto see the upper gi tract which includes the esophagus stomach and duodenum a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center the gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach a small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor allowing close examination of the stomach lining the gastroenterologist also can take a biopsy of the stomach tissue during the endoscopy a health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patients throat a health care provider will place an intravenous iv needle in a vein in the arm to administer sedation sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable the test can show enlarged folds in the stomach wall
                
biopsy biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of stomach tissue for examination with a microscope a gastroenterologist performs the biopsy at the time of upper gi endoscopy a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the stomach tissue in a lab the test can diagnose mntriers disease by showing changes in the stomachs mucous cells and acidproducing cells
                
blood test a health care provider will take a blood sample that can show the presence of infection with h pylori or cmv a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis"
causes,what causes inguinal hernia ,"the cause of inguinal hernias depends on the type of inguinal hernia
                
indirect inguinal hernias a defect in the abdominal wall that is present at birth causes an indirect inguinal hernia
                
during the development of the fetus in the womb the lining of the abdominal cavity forms and extends into the inguinal canal in males the spermatic cord and testicles descend out from inside the abdomen and through the abdominal lining to the scrotum through the inguinal canal next the abdominal lining usually closes off the entrance to the inguinal canal a few weeks before or after birth in females the ovaries do not descend out from inside the abdomen and the abdominal lining usually closes a couple of months before 
                
sometimes the lining of the abdomen does not close as it should leaving an opening in the abdominal wall at the upper part of the inguinal canal fat or part of the small intestine may slide into the inguinal canal through this opening causing a hernia in females the ovaries may also slide into the inguinal canal and cause a hernia
                
indirect hernias are the most common type of inguinal  indirect inguinal hernias may appear in  to  percent of male children however they are much less common in female children occurring in less than  
                
direct inguinal hernias direct inguinal hernias usually occur only in male adults as aging and stress or strain weaken the abdominal muscles around the inguinal canal previous surgery in the lower abdomen can also weaken the abdominal muscles
                
females rarely form this type of inguinal hernia in females the broad ligament of the uterus acts as an additional barrier behind the muscle layer of the lower abdominal wall the broad ligament of the uterus is a sheet of tissue that supports the uterus and other reproductive organs"

causes,what causes insulin resistance and prediabetes ,"although the exact causes of insulin resistance are not completely understood scientists think the major contributors to insulin resistance are excess weight and physical inactivity
                
excess weight
                
some experts believe obesity especially excess fat around the waist is a primary cause of insulin resistance scientists used to think that fat tissue functioned solely as energy storage however studies have shown that belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause serious health problems such as insulin resistance high blood pressure imbalanced cholesterol and cardiovascular disease cvd
                
belly fat plays a part in developing chronic or longlasting inflammation in the body chronic inflammation can damage the body over time without any signs or symptoms scientists have found that complex interactions in fat tissue draw immune cells to the area and trigger lowlevel chronic inflammation this inflammation can contribute to the development of insulin resistance type  diabetes and cvd studies show that losing the weight can reduce insulin resistance and prevent or delay type  diabetes
                
physical inactivity
                
many studies have shown that physical inactivity is associated with insulin resistance often leading to type  diabetes in the body more glucose is used by muscle than other tissues normally active muscles burn their stored glucose for energy and refill their reserves with glucose taken from the bloodstream keeping blood glucose levels in balance
                
studies show that after exercising muscles become more sensitive to insulin reversing insulin resistance and lowering blood glucose levels exercise also helps muscles absorb more glucose without the need for insulin the more muscle a body has the more glucose it can burn to control blood glucose levels
                
other causes
                
other causes of insulin resistance may include ethnicity certain diseases hormones steroid use some medications older age sleep problems especially sleep apnea and cigarette smoking
                

                
does sleep matter   yes studies show that untreated sleep problems especially sleep apnea can increase the risk of obesity insulin resistance and type  diabetes night shift workers may also be at increased risk for these problems sleep apnea is a common disorder in which a persons breathing is interrupted during sleep people may often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep when their breathing pauses or becomes shallow this results in poor sleep quality that causes problem sleepiness or excessive tiredness during the day   many people arent aware of their symptoms and arent diagnosed people who think they might have sleep problems should talk with their health care provider   more information about sleep problems is available from the national heart lung and blood institute at httpwwwnhlbinihgovhealthresourcessleep"
treatment,what are the treatments for what i need to know about living with kidney failure ,"kidney failure means your kidneys no longer work well enough to do their job you need treatment to replace the work your damaged kidneys have stopped doing the treatments for kidney failure are
                
 hemodialysis   peritoneal dialysis   a kidney transplant
                
your kidneys filter wastes and extra fluid from your blood to keep you healthy the wastes and extra fluid become urine that is stored in your bladder until you urinate when your kidneys fail dialysis can take over a small part of the work your damaged kidneys can no longer do you can make treatments work better by
                
 sticking to your treatment schedule   taking all medicines your doctor prescribes   following a special diet that keeps wastes from building up in your blood   being active most days of the week
                
hemodialysis
                
hemodialysis is a treatment for kidney failure hemodialysis uses a machine to filter your blood outside your body first a dialysis nurse places two needles into your arm a pump on the hemodialysis machine draws your blood through one of the needles into a tube the tube takes the blood to a filter called a dialyzer inside the dialyzer your blood flows through thin fibers that are like straws the wastes and extra fluid leave the blood through tiny holes in the fibers then a different tube carries the filtered blood back to your body through the second needle
                
more information is provided in the niddk health topics treatment methods for kidney failure hemodialysis and home hemodialysis

treatment methods for kidney failure peritoneal dialysis
                
kidney transplant
                
a kidney transplant places a healthy kidney from another person into your body the kidney may come from someone who has just died your doctor will place your name on a waiting list for a kidney a family member or friend might be able to give you a kidney then you dont have to wait
                
the new kidney takes over filtering your blood the damaged kidneys usually stay where they are the new kidney is placed in the front lower abdomen on one side of the bladder your body normally attacks anything that shouldnt be there such as bacteria your body will think the new kidney shouldnt be there you will take medicines called immunosuppressants to keep your body from attacking the new kidney

information,what is are intestinal pseudoobstruction ,"intestinal pseudoobstruction is a rare condition with symptoms that resemble those caused by a blockage or obstruction of the intestines also called the bowel however when a health care provider examines the intestines no blockage exists instead the symptoms are due to nerve or muscle problems that affect the movement of food fluid and air through the intestines
                
the intestines are part of the gastrointestinal gi tract and include the small intestine and the large intestine the small intestine is the organ where most digestion occurs the small intestine measures about  feet and includes the
                
 duodenum the first part of the small intestine   jejunum the middle section of the small intestine   ileum the lower end of the small intestine

causes,what causes polycystic kidney disease ,"a gene mutation or defect causes polycystic kidney disease genes provide instructions for making proteins in the body a gene mutation is a permanent change in the deoxyribonucleic acid dna sequence that makes up a gene in most cases of pkd a person inherits the gene mutation meaning a parent passes it on in his or her genes in the remaining cases the gene mutation develops spontaneously in spontaneous cases neither parent carries a copy of the mutated gene
                
researchers have found three different gene mutations associated with pkd two of the genes are associated with autosomal dominant pkd the third gene is associated with autosomal recessive pkd gene mutations that cause pkd affect proteins that play a role in kidney development
                

                
genetic disorders   each cell contains thousands of genes that provide the instructions for making proteins for growth and repair of the body if a gene has a mutation the protein made by that gene may not function properly which sometimes creates a genetic disorder not all gene mutations cause a disorder   people inherit two copies of most genes one copy from each parent a genetic disorder occurs when one or both parents pass a mutated gene to a child at conception a genetic disorder can also occur through a spontaneous gene mutation meaning neither parent carries a copy of the mutated gene once a spontaneous gene mutation has occurred a person can pass it to his or her children   read more about genes and genetic conditions in the us national library of medicines nlms genetics home reference"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of hepatitis b what asian and pacific islander americans need to know ,"hepatitis b is called a silent killer because many people have no symptoms so the disease often progresses unnoticed for years unfortunately many people first learn they have chronic hepatitis b when they develop symptoms of severe liver damage which include
                
 yellowish eyes and skin called jaundice   a swollen stomach or ankles   tiredness   nausea   weakness   loss of appetite   weight loss   spiderlike blood vessels called spider angiomas that develop on the skin"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of acquired cystic kidney disease ,a person with acquired cystic kidney disease often has no symptoms however the complications of acquired cystic kidney disease can have signs and symptoms
information,what is are prostate enlargement benign prostatic hyperplasia ,"benign prostatic hyperplasiaalso called bphis a condition in men in which the prostate gland is enlarged and not cancerous benign prostatic hyperplasia is also called benign prostatic hypertrophy or benign prostatic obstruction
                
the prostate goes through two main growth periods as a man ages the first occurs early in puberty when the prostate doubles in size the second phase of growth begins around age  and continues during most of a mans life benign prostatic hyperplasia often occurs with the second growth phase
                
as the prostate enlarges the gland presses against and pinches the urethra the bladder wall becomes thicker eventually the bladder may weaken and lose the ability to empty completely leaving some urine in the bladder the narrowing of the urethra and urinary retentionthe inability to empty the bladder completelycause many of the problems associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia"
causes,what causes prostate enlargement benign prostatic hyperplasia ,"the cause of benign prostatic hyperplasia is not well understood however it occurs mainly in older men benign prostatic hyperplasia does not develop in men whose testicles were removed before puberty for this reason some researchers believe factors related to aging and the testicles may cause benign prostatic hyperplasia
                
throughout their lives men produce testosterone a male hormone and small amounts of estrogen a female hormone as men age the amount of active testosterone in their blood decreases which leaves a higher proportion of estrogen scientific studies have suggested that benign prostatic hyperplasia may occur because the higher proportion of estrogen within the prostate increases the activity of substances that promote prostate cell growth
                
another theory focuses on dihydrotestosterone dht a male hormone that plays a role in prostate development and growth some research has indicated that even with a drop in blood testosterone levels older men continue to produce and accumulate high levels of dht in the prostate this accumulation of dht may encourage prostate cells to continue to grow scientists have noted that men who do not produce dht do not develop benign prostatic hyperplasia"
complications,what are the complications of prostate enlargement benign prostatic hyperplasia ,"the complications of benign prostatic hyperplasia may include
                
 acute urinary retention   chronic or long lasting urinary retention   blood in the urine   urinary tract infections utis   bladder damage   kidney damage   bladder stones
                
most men with benign prostatic hyperplasia do not develop these complications however kidney damage in particular can be a serious health threat when it occurs
                

                
when to seek medical care   a person may have urinary symptoms unrelated to benign prostatic hyperplasia that are caused by bladder problems utis or prostatitisinflammation of the prostate symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia also can signal more serious conditions including prostate cancer   men with symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia should see a health care provider   men with the following symptoms should seek immediate medical care    complete inability to urinate    painful frequent and urgent need to urinate with fever and chills    blood in the urine    great discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen and urinary tract"
exams and tests,how to diagnose prostate enlargement benign prostatic hyperplasia ,"a health care provider diagnoses benign prostatic hyperplasia based on
                
 a personal and family medical history   a physical exam   medical tests
                
personal and family medical history
                
taking a personal and family medical history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose benign prostatic hyperplasia a health care provider may ask a man
                
 what symptoms are present   when the symptoms began and how often they occur   whether he has a history of recurrent utis   what medications he takes both prescription and over the counter   how much liquid he typically drinks each day   whether he consumes caffeine and alcohol   about his general medical history including any significant illnesses or surgeries
                
physical exam
                
a physical exam may help diagnose benign prostatic hyperplasia during a physical exam a health care provider most often
                
 examines a patients body which can include checking for       discharge from the urethra     enlarged or tender lymph nodes in the groin     a swollen or tender scrotum     taps on specific areas of the patients body   performs a digital rectal exam
                
a digital rectal exam or rectal exam is a physical exam of the prostate to perform the exam the health care provider asks the man to bend over a table or lie on his side while holding his knees close to his chest the health care provider slides a gloved lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the part of the prostate that lies next to the rectum the man may feel slight brief discomfort during the rectal exam a health care provider most often performs a rectal exam during an office visit and men do not require anesthesia the exam helps the health care provider see if the prostate is enlarged or tender or has any abnormalities that require more testing
                
many health care providers perform a rectal exam as part of a routine physical exam for men age  or older whether or not they have urinary problems
                
medical tests
                
a health care provider may refer men to a urologista doctor who specializes in urinary problems and the male reproductive systemthough the health care provider most often diagnoses benign prostatic hyperplasia on the basis of symptoms and a digital rectal exam a urologist uses medical tests to help diagnose lower urinary tract problems related to benign prostatic hyperplasia and recommend treatment medical tests may include
                
 urinalysis   a prostatespecific antigen psa blood test   urodynamic tests   cystoscopy   transrectal ultrasound   biopsy
                
urinalysis urinalysis involves testing a urine sample the patient collects a urine sample in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility a health care provider tests the sample during an office visit or sends it to a lab for analysis for the test a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper called a dipstick into the urine patches on the dipstick change color to indicate signs of infection in urine
                
psa blood test a health care provider may draw blood for a psa test during an office visit or in a commercial facility and send the sample to a lab for analysis prostate cells create a protein called psa men who have prostate cancer may have a higher amount of psa in their blood however a high psa level does not necessarily indicate prostate cancer in fact benign prostatic hyperplasia prostate infections inflammation aging and normal fluctuations often cause high psa levels much remains unknown about how to interpret a psa blood test the tests ability to discriminate between cancer and prostate conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and the best course of action to take if the psa level is high
                
urodynamic tests urodynamic tests include a variety of procedures that look at how well the bladder and urethra store and release urine a health care provider performs urodynamic tests during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital some urodynamic tests do not require anesthesia others may require local anesthesia most urodynamic tests focus on the bladders ability to hold urine and empty steadily and completely and may include the following
                
 uroflowmetry which measures how rapidly the bladder releases urine   postvoid residual measurement which evaluates how much urine remains in the bladder after urination   reduced urine flow or residual urine in the bladder which often suggests urine blockage due to benign prostatic hyperplasia
                
more information is provided in the niddk health topic urodynamic testing
                
cystoscopy cystoscopy is a procedure that uses a tubelike instrument called a cystoscope to look inside the urethra and bladder a urologist inserts the cystoscope through the opening at the tip of the penis and into the lower urinary tract a urologist performs cystoscopy during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital the urologist will give the patient local anesthesia however in some cases the patient may require sedation and regional or general anesthesia a urologist may use cystoscopy to look for blockage or stones in the urinary tract
                
more information is provided in the niddk health topic cystoscopy and ureteroscopy
                
transrectal ultrasound transrectal ultrasound uses a device called a transducer that bounces safe painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure the health care provider can move the transducer to different angles to make it possible to examine different organs a specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office an outpatient center or a hospital and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images the patient does not require anesthesia urologists most often use transrectal ultrasound to examine the prostate in a transrectal ultrasound the technician inserts a transducer slightly larger than a pen into the mans rectum next to the prostate the ultrasound image shows the size of the prostate and any abnormalities such as tumors transrectal ultrasound cannot reliably diagnose prostate cancer
                
biopsy biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of prostate tissue for examination with a microscope a urologist performs the biopsy in an outpatient center or a hospital the urologist will give the patient light sedation and local anesthetic however in some cases the patient will require general anesthesia the urologist uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound a computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging to guide the biopsy needle into the prostate a pathologista doctor who specializes in examining tissues to diagnose diseasesexamines the prostate tissue in a lab the test can show whether prostate cancer is present
                
more information is provided in the niddk health topic medical tests for prostate problems"
treatment,what are the treatments for primary biliary cirrhosis ,"treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis depends on how early a health care provider diagnoses the disease and whether complications are present in the early stages of primary biliary cirrhosis treatment can slow the progression of liver damage to cirrhosis in the early stages of cirrhosis the goals of treatment are to slow the progression of tissue scarring in the liver and prevent complications as cirrhosis progresses a person may need additional treatments and hospitalization to manage complications
                
medications
                
health care providers prescribe ursodiol actigall urso to treat primary biliary cirrhosis ursodiol is a nontoxic bile acid that people can take orally ursodiol replaces the bile acids that are normally produced by the liver which are more toxic and can harm the liver treatment with ursodiol can reduce levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes in the blood early treatment with this medication reduces the likelihood of needing a liver transplant and improves  early treatment provides the most benefit however ursodiol treatment late in the course of the disease can still slow the progression of liver damage while ursodiol treatment improves the outcome of primary biliary cirrhosis it does not cure the disease
                
researchers are studying the effects of several other medications on the progression of primary biliary cirrhosis to date none has shown the positive effects of ursodiol
                
avoiding alcohol and other substances
                
people with cirrhosis should not drink any alcohol or take any illegal substances as both will cause more liver damage people with cirrhosis should avoid complementary and alternative medications such as herbs people with cirrhosis should be careful about starting new medications and should consult a health care provider before taking prescription medications overthecounter medications or vitamins many vitamins and prescription and overthecounter medications can affect liver function
                
treatment of symptoms and complications
                
health care providers treat symptoms and complications as follows
                
itching antihistamines may help with mild itching however antihistamines often cause drowsiness and a person should take antihistamines just before bedtime to help with nighttime itching a health care provider will treat more problematic itching with cholestyramine locholest questran which reduces cholesterol in the blood experts believe high levels of cholesterol let substances that cause itching build up in tissues
                
dry eyes and mouth health care providers usually treat dry eyes and mouth with artificial tears and saliva substitutes respectively these products are available without a prescription a health care provider may treat people whose symptoms do not improve with pilocarpine salagen or cevimeline evoxac people who have difficulty with dry eyes should see an ophthalmologista doctor who diagnoses and treats all eye diseases and eye disordersregularly people with dry mouth should have regular dental exams
                
portal hypertension a health care provider may prescribe a betablocker or nitrate to treat portal hypertension betablockers lower blood pressure by helping the heart beat slower and with less force and nitrates relax and widen blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart and reduce the hearts workload
                
varices betablockers can lower the pressure in varices and reduce the likelihood of bleeding bleeding in the stomach or esophagus requires an immediate upper endoscopy this procedure involves using an endoscope to look for varices the health care provider may use the endoscope to perform a band ligation a procedure that involves placing a special rubber band around the varices that causes the tissue to die and fall off a gastroenterologist performs the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center people who have had varices in the past may need to take medication to prevent future episodes
                
edema and ascites health care providers prescribe diureticsmedications that remove fluid from the bodyto treat edema and ascites a health care provider may remove large amounts of ascitic fluid from the abdomen and check for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis a health care provider may prescribe bacteriafighting medications called antibiotics to prevent infection he or she may prescribe oral antibiotics however severe infection with ascites requires intravenous iv antibiotics
                
hepatic encephalopathy a health care provider will treat hepatic encephalopathy by cleansing the bowel with lactulose a laxative given orally or as an enemaa liquid put into the rectum a health care provider may also add antibiotics to the treatment hepatic encephalopathy may improve as other complications of cirrhosis are controlled
                
osteoporosis a health care provider may prescribe bisphosphonate medications to improve bone density
                
gallstones and bile duct stones a health care provider may use surgery to remove gallstones he or she may use endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which uses balloons and basketlike devices to retrieve the bile duct stones
                
liver cancer a health care provider may recommend screening tests every  to  months to check for signs of liver cancer screening tests can find cancer before the person has symptoms of the disease cancer treatment is usually more effective when the health care provider finds the disease early health care providers use blood tests ultrasound or both to screen for liver cancer in people with cirrhosis he or she may treat cancer with a combination of surgery radiation and chemotherapy"
considerations,what to do for kidney disease of diabetes , diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease ckd and kidney failure in the united states   people with diabetes should be screened regularly for kidney disease the two key markers for kidney disease are estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr and urine albumin   drugs used to lower blood pressure can slow the progression of kidney disease significantly two types of drugs angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease   in people with diabetes excessive consumption of protein may be harmful   intensive management of blood glucose has shown great promise for people with diabetes especially for those in the early stages of ckd

some people with wilson disease may not develop signs or symptoms of liver disease until they develop acute liver failurea condition that develops suddenly
                
central nervous systemrelated signs and symptoms
                
central nervous systemrelated symptoms usually appear in people after the liver has retained a lot of copper however signs and symptoms of liver disease may not be present central nervous systemrelated symptoms occur most often in adults and sometimes occur in  signs and symptoms include
                
 tremors or uncontrolled movements   muscle stiffness   problems with speech swallowing or physical coordination

considerations,what to do for wilson disease ,"people with wilson disease should reduce their dietary copper intake by avoiding foods that are high in copper such as
                
 shellfish   liver   mushrooms   nuts   chocolate
                
people should not eat these foods during the initial treatment and talk with the health care provider to discuss if they are safe to eat in moderation during maintenance treatment
                
people with wilson disease whose tap water runs through copper pipes or comes from a well should check the copper levels in the tap water water that sits in copper pipes may pick up copper residue but running water lowers the level to within acceptable limits people with wilson disease should not use copper containers or cookware to store or prepare food or drinks
                
to help ensure coordinated and safe care people should discuss their use of complementary and alternative medical practices including their use of vitamins and dietary supplements with their health care provider read more at wwwnccam nihgovhealth if the health care provider recommends taking any type of supplement or vitamin a pharmacist can recommend types that do not contain copper
                
people should talk with a health care provider about diet changes to reduce copper intake
                
liver transplant
                
a liver transplant may be necessary in people when
                
 cirrhosis leads to liver failure   acute liver failure happens suddenly   treatment is not effective
                
a liver transplant is an operation to remove a diseased or an injured liver and replace it with a healthy one from another person called a donor a successful transplant is a lifesaving treatment for people with liver failure
                
most liver transplants are successful about  percent of transplanted livers are functioning after   liver transplant surgery provides a cure for wilson disease in most cases more information is provided in the niddk health topic liver transplantation"

considerations,what to do for abdominal adhesions ,researchers have not found that eating diet and nutrition play a role in causing or preventing abdominal adhesions a person with a partial intestinal obstruction may relieve symptoms with a liquid or low fiber diet which is more easily broken down into smaller particles by the digestive system
exams and tests,how to diagnose crohns disease ,"a health care provider diagnoses crohns disease with the following
                
 medical and family history   physical exam   lab tests   upper gi series   computerized tomography ct scan   intestinal endoscopy
                
the health care provider may perform a series of medical tests to rule out other bowel diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome ulcerative colitis or celiac disease that cause symptoms similar to those of crohns disease
                
medical and family history
                
taking a medical and family history can help a health care provider diagnose crohns disease and understand a patients symptoms he or she will ask the patient to describe his or her
                
 family history   symptoms   current and past medical conditions   current medications
                
physical exam
                
a physical exam may help diagnose crohns disease during a physical exam the health care provider most often
                
 checks for abdominal distension or swelling   listens to sounds within the abdomen using a stethoscope   taps on the abdomen to check for tenderness and pain and establish if the liver or spleen is abnormal or enlarged
                
lab tests
                
a health care provider may order lab tests including blood and stool tests
                
blood tests a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a lab a lab technologist will analyze the blood sample a health care provider may use blood tests to look for changes in
                
 red blood cells when red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal a patient may have anemia   white blood cells when the white blood cell count is higher than normal a person may have inflammation or infection somewhere in his or her body
                
stool tests a stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool a health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool at home the patient returns the sample to the health care provider or to a lab a lab technologist will analyze the stool sample health care providers commonly order stool tests to rule out other causes of gi diseases
                
upper gastrointestinal series
                
an upper gi series also called a barium swallow uses xrays and fluoroscopy to help diagnose problems of the upper gi tract fluoroscopy is a form of xray that makes it possible to see the internal organs and their motion on a video monitor an xray technician performs this test at a hospital or an outpatient center and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images
                
this test does not require anesthesia a patient should not eat or drink before the procedure as directed by the health care provider patients should ask their health care provider about how to prepare for an upper gi series
                
during the procedure the patient will stand or sit in front of an xray machine and drink barium a chalky liquid barium coats the esophagus stomach and small intestine so the radiologist and a health care provider can see the shape of these organs more clearly on xrays
                
a patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test for several days afterward barium liquid in the gi tract causes white or lightcolored stools a health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test
                
computerized tomography scan
                
computerized tomography scans use a combination of xrays and computer technology to create images for a ct scan a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye called contrast medium ct scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnelshaped device where the xrays are taken an xray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital and a radiologist interprets the images the patient does not need anesthesia ct scans can diagnose both crohns disease and the complications seen with the disease
                
intestinal endoscopy
                
intestinal endoscopies are the most accurate methods for diagnosing crohns disease and ruling out other possible conditions such as ulcerative colitis diverticular disease or cancer intestinal endoscopies include
                
 upper gi endoscopy and enteroscopy   capsule endoscopy   colonoscopy
                
upper gi endoscopy and enteroscopy an upper gi endoscopy is a procedure that uses an endoscopea small flexible tube with a lightto directly visualize the lining of the upper gi tract a health care provider performs the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center a nurse or technician may give the patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or will spray the anesthetic on the back of a patients throat the anesthetic numbs the throat and calms the gag reflex the nurse or technician will then place an intravenous iv needle in the persons arm or hand to provide a sedative the health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the patients esophagus and into the stomach a small camera on the endoscope sends a video image to a monitor allowing close examination of the gi tract
                
during an enteroscopy the health care provider examines the small intestine with a special longer endoscope the health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope into the small intestine using one of the following procedures
                
 push enteroscopy which uses a long endoscope to examine the upper portion of the small intestine   single or doubleballoon enteroscopy which use small balloons to help move the endoscope into the small intestine   spiral enteroscopy which uses a tube attached to an endocope that acts as a cork screw to move the instrument into the small intestine
                
the procedure most often takes between  and  minutes the endoscope does not interfere with the patients breathing and many patients fall asleep during the procedure
                
capsule endoscopy although this procedure can examine the entire digestive tract health care providers use it mostly to examine the small intestine the patient swallows a capsule containing a tiny camera as the capsule passes through the gi tract the camera will record and transmit images to a small receiver device worn by the patient when the recording is done the health care provider downloads the images and reviews them on a video monitor the camera capsule leaves the patients body during a bowel movement and is safely flushed down the toilet
                
colonoscopy colonoscopy is a test that uses a long flexible narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end called a colonoscope or scope to look inside a patients rectum and entire colon in most cases light anesthesia and pain medication help patients relax for the test the medical staff will monitor a patients vital signs and try to make him or her as comfortable as possible a nurse or technician will place an iv needle in a vein in the patients arm or hand to give anesthesia
                
for the test the patient will lie on a table or stretcher while the gastroenterologist inserts a colonoscope into the patients anus and slowly guides it through the rectum and into the colon the scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the gastroenterologist a better view the camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a monitor allowing the gastroenterologist to examine the tissues lining the colon and rectum the gastroenterologist may move the patient several times and adjust the scope for better viewing once the scope has reached the opening to the small intestine the gastroenterologist slowly withdraws it and examines the lining of the colon and rectum again
                
a colonoscopy can show inflamed and swollen tissue ulcers and abnormal growths such as polypsextra pieces of tissue that grow on the inner lining of the intestine if the gastroenterologist suspects crohns disease he or she will biopsy the patients colon and rectum a biopsy is a procedure that involves taking small pieces of tissue for examination with a microscope
                
a health care provider will give patients written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test the health care provider will also give patients information about how to care for themselves following the procedure"
considerations,what to do for diabetic neuropathies the nerve damage of diabetes , diabetic neuropathies are nerve disorders caused by many of the abnormalities common to diabetes such as high blood glucose   neuropathy can affect nerves throughout the body causing numbness and sometimes pain in the hands arms feet or legs and problems with the digestive tract heart sex organs and other body systems   treatment first involves bringing blood glucose levels within the normal range good blood glucose control may help prevent or delay the onset of further problems   foot care is an important part of treatment people with neuropathy need to inspect their feet daily for any injuries untreated injuries increase the risk of infected foot sores and amputation   treatment also includes pain relief and other medications as needed depending on the type of nerve damage   smoking increases the risk of foot problems and amputation a health care provider may be able to provide help with quitting
treatment,what are the treatments for national hormone and pituitary program nhpp information for people treated with pituitary human growth hormone comprehensive report ,"before scientists learned how to make synthetic hormones many animal hormones such as insulin were used to treat human disorders growth hormone from animals did not work in humans human growth hormone pituitary hgh was therefore made from human pituitary glands by the national hormone and pituitary program nhpp funded by the us department of health and human services hhs from  to  the nhpp sent pituitary hgh to hundreds of doctors across the country as a part of research studies doctors used the hormone to treat nearly  children for failure to grow
                
in  the hhs learned that three young men treated with pituitary hgh died of creutzfeldtjakob disease cjd a rare and incurable brain disease the hhs believed these illnesses were related to pituitary hgh the hhs immediately stopped the distribution of the hormone and began a national study to learn more about how pituitary hgh treatment may have caused this problem the hhs continues to monitor individuals who received pituitary hgh through the nhpp for cjd"

treatment,what are the treatments for cyclic vomiting syndrome ,"a health care provider may refer patients to a gastroenterologist for treatment
                
people with cyclic vomiting syndrome should get plenty of rest and take medications to prevent a vomiting episode stop an episode in progress speed up recovery or relieve associated symptoms
                
the health care team tailors treatment to the symptoms experienced during each of the four cyclic vomiting syndrome phases
                
 prodrome phase treatment the goal during the prodrome phase is to stop an episode before it progresses taking medication early in the phase can help stop an episode from moving to the vomiting phase or becoming severe however people do not always realize an episode is coming for example a person may wake up in the morning and begin vomiting a health care provider may recommend the following medications for both children and adults       ondansetron zofran or lorazepam ativan for nausea     ibuprofen for abdominal pain     ranitidine zantac lansoprazole prevacid or omeprazole prilosec zegerid to control stomach acid production     sumatriptan imitrexprescribed as a nasal spray an injection or a pill that dissolves under the tonguefor migraines     vomiting phase treatment once vomiting begins people should call or see a health care provider as soon as possible treatment usually requires the person to stay in bed and sleep in a dark quiet room a health care provider may recommend the following for both children and adults       medication for pain nausea and reducing stomach acid and anxiety     antimigraine medications such as sumatriptan to stop symptoms of a migraine or possibly stop an episode in progress     hospitalization for severe nausea and vomiting     iv fluids and medications to prevent dehydration and treat symptoms     iv nutrition if an episode continues for several days     recovery phase treatment during the recovery phase drinking and eating will replace lost electrolytes a person may need iv fluids for a period of time some people find their appetite returns to normal right away while others start by drinking clear liquids and then moving slowly to other liquids and solid food a health care provider may prescribe medications during the recovery phase and well phase to prevent future episodes   well phase treatment during the well phase a health care provider may use medications to treat people whose episodes are frequent and long lasting in an effort to prevent or ease future episodes a person may need to take a medication daily for  to  months before evaluating whether it helps prevent episodes a health care provider may prescribe the following medications for both children and adults during the well phase to prevent cyclic vomiting syndrome episodes lessen their severity and reduce their frequency       amitriptyline elavil     propranolol inderal     cyproheptadine periactin"
considerations,what to do for urinary retention ,researchers have not found that eating diet and nutrition play a role in causing or preventing urinary retention
information,what is are proteinuria ,"proteinuriaalso called albuminuria or urine albuminis a condition in which urine contains an abnormal amount of protein albumin is the main protein in the blood proteins are the building blocks for all body parts including muscles bones hair and nails proteins in the blood also perform a number of important functions they protect the body from infection help blood clot and keep the right amount of fluid circulating throughout the body
                
as blood passes through healthy kidneys they filter out the waste products and leave in the things the body needs like albumin and other proteins most proteins are too big to pass through the kidneys filters into the urine however proteins from the blood can leak into the urine when the filters of the kidney called glomeruli are damaged
                
proteinuria is a sign of chronic kidney disease ckd which can result from diabetes high blood pressure and diseases that cause inflammation in the kidneys for this reason testing for albumin in the urine is part of a routine medical assessment for everyone kidney disease is sometimes called renal disease if ckd progresses it can lead to endstage renal disease esrd when the kidneys fail completely a person with esrd must receive a kidney transplant or regular bloodcleansing treatments called dialysis"
susceptibility,who is at risk for proteinuria ,"people with diabetes hypertension or certain family backgrounds are at risk for proteinuria in the united states diabetes is the leading cause of  in both type  and type  diabetes albumin in the urine is one of the first signs of deteriorating kidney function as kidney function declines the amount of albumin in the urine increases
                
another risk factor for developing proteinuria is hypertension or high blood pressure proteinuria in a person with high blood pressure is an indicator of declining kidney function if the hypertension is not controlled the person can progress to full kidney failure
                
african americans are more likely than caucasians to have high blood pressure and to develop kidney problems from it even when their blood pressure is only mildly elevated in fact african americans are six times more likely than caucasians to develop hypertensionrelated kidney 
                
other groups at risk for proteinuria are american indians hispanicslatinos pacific islander americans older adults and overweight people these atrisk groups and people who have a family history of kidney disease should have their urine tested regularly"
causes,what causes nephrotic syndrome in adults ,"nephrotic syndrome can be caused by diseases that affect only the kidneys such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis fsgs or membranous nephropathy diseases that affect only the kidneys are called primary causes of nephrotic syndrome the glomeruli are usually the targets of these diseases for reasons that are not fully understood in fsgsthe most common primary cause of nephrotic syndromescar tissue forms in parts of the glomeruli in membranous nephropathy immune molecules form harmful deposits on the glomeruli
                
nephrotic syndrome can also be caused by systemic diseases which are diseases that affect many parts of the body such as diabetes or lupus systemic diseases that affect the kidneys are called secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome more than  percent of nephrotic syndrome cases in adults have secondary causes with diabetes being the most "
symptoms,what are the symptoms of what i need to know about diarrhea ,"in addition to passing frequent loose stools other possible symptoms include
                
 cramps or pain in the abdomenthe area between the chest and hips   an urgent need to use the bathroom   loss of bowel control
                
you may feel sick to your stomach or become dehydrated if a virus or bacteria is the cause of your diarrhea you may have fever and chills and bloody stools
                
dehydration
                
being dehydrated means your body does not have enough fluid to work properly every time you have a bowel movement you lose fluids diarrhea causes you to lose even more fluids you also lose salts and minerals such as sodium chloride and potassium these salts and minerals affect the amount of water that stays in your body
                
dehydration can be serious especially for children older adults and people with weakened immune systems
                
signs of dehydration in adults are
                
 being thirsty   urinating less often than usual   having darkcolored urine   having dry skin   feeling tired   feeling dizzy or fainting
                
signs of dehydration in babies and young children are
                
 having a dry mouth and tongue   crying without tears   having no wet diapers for  hours or more   having sunken eyes cheeks or soft spot in the skull   having a high fever   being more cranky or drowsy than usual
                
also when people are dehydrated their skin does not flatten back to normal right away after being gently pinched and released"
considerations,what to do for what i need to know about diarrhea ,"to prevent dehydration when you have diarrhea it is important to drink plenty of water but you also need to drink fluids that contain sodium chloride and potassium
                
 adults should drink water fruit juices sports drinks sodas without caffeine and salty broths   children should drink oral rehydration solutionsspecial drinks that contain salts and minerals to prevent dehydration these drinks include pedialyte naturalyte infalyte and ceralyte these drinks are sold in most grocery stores and drugstores
                
 bananas   plain rice   boiled potatoes   toast   crackers   cooked carrots   baked chicken without the skin or fat
                
if a certain food is the cause of diarrhea try to avoid it
                
 drinks with caffeine such as coffee and cola   highfat or greasy foods such as fried foods   foods with a lot of fiber such as citrus fruits   sweet foods such as cakes and cookies
                
during or after an episode of diarrhea some people have trouble digesting lactose the sugar in milk and milk products however you may be able to digest yogurt eating yogurt with active live bacterial cultures may even help you feel better faster
                
when babies have diarrhea continue breastfeeding or formula feeding as usual
                
after you have had diarrhea caused by a virus problems digesting lactose may last up to  to  weeks you may have diarrhea for a short time after you eat or drink milk or milk products"
prevention,how to prevent what i need to know about diarrhea ,"two types of diarrhea can be preventedrotavirus diarrhea and travelers diarrhea
                
rotavirus diarrhea
                
two vaccines rotateq and rotarix protect against rotavirusa common virus that causes diarrhea in babies and children rotateq is given to babies in three doses at   and  months of age rotarix is given in two doses the first dose is given when the baby is  weeks old and the second is given at least  weeks later but before the baby is  weeks old to learn more about rotavirus vaccines talk with your childs health care provider you can also find more information at the centers for disease control and prevention rotavirus vaccination webpage at wwwcdcgovvaccinesvpdvacrotavirus
                
rotateq and rotarix only prevent diarrhea caused by rotavirus children who have been vaccinated may still get diarrhea from another cause
                
travelers diarrhea
                

                
people may develop travelers diarrhea while visiting developing areas of the world such as latin america africa and southern asia travelers diarrhea is caused by eating food or drinking water that contains harmful bacteria viruses or parasites
                
you can prevent travelers diarrhea by being careful
                
 do not drink tap water use tap water to brush your teeth or use ice cubes made from tap water   do not eat or drink unpasteurized milk or milk products   do not eat raw fruits and vegetables unless they can be peeled and you peel them yourself   do not eat raw or rare meat and fish   do not eat meat or shellfish that is not hot when served to you   do not eat food sold by street vendors
                
you can drink bottled water carbonated soft drinks and hot drinks such as coffee and tea
                
before traveling outside the united states talk with your health care provider your health care provider may suggest taking medicine with you in some cases taking antibiotics before traveling can help prevent travelers diarrhea and early treatment with antibiotics can shorten an episode of travelers diarrhea"
exams and tests,how to diagnose alagille syndrome ,"a health care provider diagnoses alagille syndrome by performing a thorough physical exam and ordering one or more of the following tests and exams
                
 blood test   urinalysis   x ray   abdominal ultrasound   cardiology exam   slitlamp exam   liver biopsy   genetic testing
                
alagille syndrome can be difficult to diagnose because the signs and symptoms vary and the syndrome is so rare
                
for a diagnosis of alagille syndrome three of the following symptoms typically should be present
                
 liver symptoms such as jaundice pruritus malabsorption and xanthomas   heart abnormalities or murmurs   skeletal abnormalities   posterior embryotoxon   facial features typical of alagille syndrome   kidney disease   blood vessel problems
                
a health care provider may perform a liver biopsy to diagnose alagille syndrome however it is not necessary to make a diagnosis a diagnosis can be made in a person who does not meet the clinical criteria of alagille syndrome yet does have a gene mutation of  the health care provider may have a blood sample tested to look for the  gene mutation the gene mutation can be identified in  percent of people with a diagnosis of alagille 
                
blood test a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis the blood test can show nutritional status and the presence of liver disease and kidney function
                
urinalysis urinalysis is the testing of a urine sample the urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis urinalysis can show many problems of the urinary tract and other body systems the sample may be observed for color cloudiness or concentration signs of drug use chemical composition including glucose the presence of protein blood cells or bacteria or other signs of disease
                
x ray an x ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer the amount of radiation used is small an xray technician performs the x ray at a hospital or an outpatient center and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images anesthesia is not needed the patient will lie on a table or stand during the x ray the technician positions the xray machine over the spine area to look for butterfly vertebrae the patient will hold his or her breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry the patient may be asked to change position for additional pictures
                
abdominal ultrasound ultrasound uses a device called a transducer that bounces safe painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure the transducer can be moved to different angles to make it possible to examine different organs in abdominal ultrasound the health care provider applies a gel to the patients abdomen and moves a handheld transducer over the skin the gel allows the transducer to glide easily and it improves the transmission of the signals a specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office an outpatient center or a hospital and a radiologist interprets the images anesthesia is not needed the images can show an enlarged liver or rule out other conditions
                
cardiology exam a cardiologista doctor who treats people who have heart problemsperforms a cardiology exam in a health care providers office an outpatient center or a hospital during a full exam a cardiologist may inspect the patients physical appearance measure pulse rate and blood pressure observe the jugular vein check for rapid or skipped heartbeats listen for variations in heart sounds and listen to the lungs
                
slitlamp exam an ophthalmologista doctor who diagnoses and treats all eye diseases and eye disordersperforms a slitlamp exam to diagnose posterior embryotoxon the ophthalmologist examines the eye with a slit lamp a microscope combined with a highintensity light that shines a thin beam on the eye while sitting in a chair the patient will rest his or her head on the slit lamp a yellow dye may be used to examine the cornea and tear layer the dye is applied as a drop or the specialist may touch a strip of paper stained with the dye to the white of the patients eye the specialist will also use drops in the patients eye to dilate the pupil
                
liver biopsy a liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease the health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy the patient may be asked to fast for  hours before the procedure
                
during the procedure the patient lies on a table right hand resting above the head a local anesthetic is applied to the area where the biopsy needle will be inserted if needed sedatives and pain medication are also given the health care provider uses a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue the health care provider may use ultrasound computerized tomography scans or other imaging techniques to guide the needle after the biopsy the patient should lie on the right side for up to  hours and is monitored an additional  to  hours before being sent home
                
genetic testing the health care provider may refer a person suspected of having alagille syndrome to a geneticista doctor who specializes in genetic disorders for a genetic test the geneticist takes a blood or saliva sample and analyzes the dna for the  gene mutation the geneticist tests for the  gene mutation first since it is more common in alagille syndrome than  genetic testing is often done only by specialized labs the results may not be available for several months because of the complexity of the testing
                
the usefulness of genetic testing for alagille syndrome is limited by two factors
                
 detection of a mutated gene cannot predict the onset of symptoms or how serious the disorder will be   even if a mutated gene is found no specific cure for the disorder exists
                

                
when to consider genetic counseling   people who are considering genetic testing may want to consult a genetics counselor genetic counseling can help family members understand how test results may affect them individually and as a family genetic counseling is provided by genetics professionalshealth care professionals with specialized degrees and experience in medical genetics and counseling genetics professionals include geneticists genetics counselors and genetics nurses   genetics professionals work as members of health care teams providing information and support to individuals or families who have genetic disorders or a higher chance of having an inherited condition genetics professionals    assess the likelihood of a genetic disorder by researching a familys history evaluating medical records and conducting a physical exam of the patient and other family members    weigh the medical social and ethical decisions surrounding genetic testing    provide support and information to help a person make a decision about testing    interpret the results of genetic tests and medical data    provide counseling or refer individuals and families to support services    serve as patient advocates    explain possible treatments or preventive measures    discuss reproductive options    genetic counseling may be useful when a family member is deciding whether to have genetic testing and again later when test results are available"
prevention,how to prevent alagille syndrome ,scientists have not yet found a way to prevent alagille syndrome however complications of the disorder can be managed with the help of health care providers routine visits with a health care team are needed to prevent complications from becoming worse
causes,what causes overview of kidney disease in children ,"kidney disease in children can be caused by
                
 birth defects   hereditary diseases   infection   nephrotic syndrome   systemic diseases   trauma   urine blockage or reflux
                
from birth to age  birth defects and hereditary diseases are the leading causes of kidney failure between ages  and  kidney failure is most commonly caused by hereditary diseases nephrotic syndrome and systemic diseases between ages  and  diseases that affect the glomeruli are the leading cause of kidney failure and hereditary diseases become less 
                
birth defects
                
a birth defect is a problem that happens while a baby is developing in the mothers womb birth defects that affect the kidneys include renal agenesis renal dysplasia and ectopic kidney to name a few these defects are abnormalities of size structure or position of the kidneys
                
 renal agenesischildren born with only one kidney   renal dysplasiachildren born with both kidneys yet one does not function   ectopic kidneychildren born with a kidney that is located below above or on the opposite side of its usual position
                
in general children with these conditions lead full healthy lives however some children with renal agenesis or renal dysplasia are at increased risk for developing kidney disease
                
hereditary diseases
                
hereditary kidney diseases are illnesses passed from parent to child through the genes one example is polycystic kidney disease pkd characterized by many grapelike clusters of fluidfilled cystsabnormal sacsthat make both kidneys larger over time these cysts take over and destroy working kidney tissue another hereditary disease is alport syndrome which is caused by a mutation in a gene for a type of protein called collagen that makes up the glomeruli the condition leads to scarring of the kidneys alport syndrome generally develops in early childhood and is more serious in boys than in girls the condition can lead to hearing and vision problems in addition to kidney disease
                
infection
                
hemolytic uremic syndrome and acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis are kidney diseases that can develop in a child after an infection
                
 hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare disease that is often caused by the escherichia coli e coli bacterium found in contaminated foods such as meat dairy products and juice hemolytic uremic syndrome develops when e coli bacteria lodged in the digestive tract make toxins that enter the bloodstream the toxins start to destroy red blood cells and damage the lining of the blood vessels including the glomeruli most children who get an e coli infection have vomiting stomach cramps and bloody diarrhea for  to  days children who develop hemolytic uremic syndrome become pale tired and irritable hemolytic uremic syndrome can lead to kidney failure in some children   poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis can occur after an episode of strep throat or a skin infection the streptococcus bacterium does not attack the kidneys directly instead the infection may stimulate the immune system to overproduce antibodies antibodies are proteins made by the immune system the immune system protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria viruses and other potentially harmful foreign substances when the extra antibodies circulate in the blood and finally deposit in the glomeruli the kidneys can be damaged most cases of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis develop  to  weeks after an untreated infection though it may be as long as  weeks poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis lasts only a brief time and the kidneys usually recover in a few cases kidney damage may be permanent
                
nephrotic syndrome
                
nephrotic syndrome is a collection of symptoms that indicate kidney damage nephrotic syndrome includes all of the following conditions
                
 albuminuriawhen a persons urine contains an elevated level of albumin a protein typically found in the blood   hyperlipidemiahigherthannormal fat and cholesterol levels in the blood   edemaswelling usually in the legs feet or ankles and less often in the hands or face   hypoalbuminemialow levels of albumin in the blood
                
nephrotic syndrome in children can be caused by the following conditions
                
 minimal change disease is a condition characterized by damage to the glomeruli that can be seen only with an electron microscope which shows tiny details better than any other type of microscope the cause of minimal change disease is unknown some health care providers think it may occur after allergic reactions vaccinations and viral infections   focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is scarring in scattered regions of the kidney typically limited to a small number of glomeruli   membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a group of autoimmune diseases that cause antibodies to build up on a membrane in the kidney autoimmune diseases cause the bodys immune system to attack the bodys own cells and organs
                
systemic diseases
                
systemic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus sle or lupus and diabetes involve many organs or the whole body including the kidneys
                
 lupus nephritis is kidney inflammation caused by sle which is an autoimmune disease   diabetes leads to elevated levels of blood glucose also called blood sugar which scar the kidneys and increase the speed at which blood flows into the kidneys faster blood flow strains the glomeruli decreasing their ability to filter blood and raises blood pressure kidney disease caused by diabetes is called diabetic kidney disease while diabetes is the number one cause of kidney failure in adults it is an uncommon cause during childhood
                
more information about systemic kidney diseases is provided in the niddk health topics
                
 lupus nephritis   kidney disease of diabetes
                
trauma
                
traumas such as burns dehydration bleeding injury or surgery can cause very low blood pressure which decreases blood flow to the kidneys low blood flow can result in acute kidney failure
                
urine blockage or reflux
                
when a blockage develops between the kidneys and the urethra urine can back up into the kidneys and cause damage refluxurine flowing from the bladder up to the kidneyhappens when the valve between the bladder and the ureter does not close all the way"
information,what is are graves disease ,"graves disease also known as toxic diffuse goiter is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the united states hyperthyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormone than the body needs
                
the thyroid
                
the thyroid is a  butterflyshaped gland in the front of the neck below the larynx or voice box the thyroid makes two thyroid hormones triiodothyronine   and thyroxine    is made from  and is the more active hormone directly affecting the tissues thyroid hormones circulate throughout the body in the bloodstream and act on virtually every tissue and cell in the body
                
thyroid hormones affect metabolism brain development breathing heart and nervous system functions body temperature muscle strength skin dryness menstrual cycles weight and cholesterol levels hyperthyroidism causes many of the bodys functions to speed up
                
thyroid hormone production is regulated by another hormone called thyroidstimulating hormone tsh which is made by the pituitary gland in the brain when thyroid hormone levels in the blood are low the pituitary releases more tsh when thyroid hormone levels are high the pituitary responds by decreasing tsh production
                

                
autoimmune disorder
                
graves disease is an autoimmune disorder normally the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria viruses and other potentially harmful foreign substances but in autoimmune diseases the immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs
                
with graves disease the immune system makes an antibody called thyroidstimulating immunoglobulin tsisometimes called tsh receptor antibodythat attaches to thyroid cells tsi mimics tsh and stimulates the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone sometimes the tsi antibody instead blocks thyroid hormone production leading to conflicting symptoms that may make correct diagnosis more difficult"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of simple kidney cysts ,simple kidney cysts usually do not cause symptoms or harm the kidneys in some cases however pain can occur between the ribs and hips when cysts enlarge and press on other organs sometimes cysts become infected causing fever pain and tenderness simple kidney cysts are not thought to affect kidney function but one study found an association between the presence of cysts and reduced kidney function in hospitalized people younger than  years of  some studies have found a relationship between simple kidney cysts and high blood pressure for example high blood pressure has improved in some people after a large cyst was drained however this relationship is not well 
treatment,what are the treatments for what i need to know about bladder control for women ,"your doctor will likely offer several treatment choices some treatments are as simple as changing some daily habits other treatments require taking medicine or using a device if nothing else seems to work surgery may help a woman with stress incontinence regain her bladder control
                
talk with your doctor about which treatments might work best for you
                
pelvic muscle strengthening
                
many women prefer to try the simplest treatment choices first kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic muscles and dont require any equipment once you learn how to kegel you can kegel anywhere the trick is finding the right muscles to squeeze your doctor or nurse can help make sure you are squeezing the right muscles your doctor may refer you to a specially trained physical therapist who will teach you to find and strengthen the sphincter muscles learning when to squeeze these muscles can also help stop the bladder spasms that cause urge incontinence after about  to  weeks you should notice that you have fewer leaks and more bladder control use the pelvic muscle exercise log included with the kegel exercise tips sheet item c to keep track of your progress
                
changing habits
                
timed voiding by keeping track of the times you leak urine you may notice certain times of day when you are most likely to have an accident you can use that information to make planned trips to the bathroom ahead of time to avoid the accident once you have established a safe pattern you can build your bladder control by stretching out the time between trips to the bathroom by forcing your pelvic muscles to hold on longer you make those muscles stronger
                
diet changes you may notice that certain foods and drinks cause you to urinate more often you may find that avoiding caffeinated drinks like coffee tea or cola helps your bladder control you can choose the decaf version of your favorite drink make sure you are not drinking too much fluid because that will cause you to make a large amount of urine if you are bothered by nighttime urination drink most of your fluids during the day and limit your drinking after dinner you should not however avoid drinking fluids for fear of having an accident some foods may irritate your bladder and cause urgency talk with your doctor about diet changes that might affect your bladder
                
weight loss extra body weight puts extra pressure on your bladder by losing weight you may be able to relieve some of that pressure and regain your bladder control
                
medicines
                
no medications are approved to treat stress urinary incontinence but if you have an overactive bladder your doctor may prescribe a medicine that can calm muscles and nerves medicines for overactive bladder come as pills liquid or a patch
                
medicines to treat overactive bladder can cause your eyes to become dry these medicines can also cause dry mouth and constipation if you take medicine to treat an overactive bladder you may need to take steps to deal with the side effects
                
 use eye drops to keep your eyes moist   chew gum or suck on hard candy if dry mouth bothers you make it sugarless gum or candy to avoid tooth decay   take small sips of water throughout the day
                
medicines for other conditions also can affect the nerves and muscles of the urinary tract in different ways pills to treat swellingedemaor high blood pressure may increase urine output and contribute to bladder control problems
                
talk with your doctor you may find that taking a different medicine solves the problem without adding another prescription the list of medicines for bladder control item d will give you more information about specific medicines
                
pessaries
                
a pessary is a plastic ring similar to a contraceptive diaphragm that is worn in the vagina it will help support the walls of the vagina lifting the bladder and nearby urethra leading to less stress leakage a doctor or nurse can fit you with the best shape and size pessary for you and teach you how to care for it many women use a pessary only during exercise while others wear their pessary all day to reduce stress leakage if you use a pessary you should see your doctor regularly to check for small scrapes in the vagina that can result from using the device
                
nerve stimulation
                
electrical stimulation of the nerves that control the bladder can improve symptoms of urgency frequency and urge incontinence as well as bladder emptying problems in some people this treatment is usually offered to patients who cannot tolerate or do not benefit from medications at first your doctor will use a device outside your body to deliver stimulation through a wire implanted under your skin to see if the treatment relieves your symptoms if the temporary treatment works well for you you may be able to have a permanent device implanted that delivers stimulation to the nerves in your back much like a pacemaker the electrodes in the permanent device are placed in your lower back through a minor surgical procedure you may need to return to the doctor for adjustments to find the right setting that controls your bladder symptoms
                
surgery
                
doctors may suggest surgery to improve bladder control if other treatments have failed surgery helps only stress incontinence it wont work for urge incontinence many surgical options have high rates of success
                
most stress incontinence problems are caused by the bladder neck dropping toward the vagina to correct this problem the surgeon raises the bladder neck or urethra and supports it with a ribbonlike sling or web of strings attached to a muscle or bone the sling holds up the bottom of the bladder and the top of the urethra to stop leakage
                
catheterization
                
if your bladder does not empty well as a result of nerve damage you might leak urine this condition is called overflow incontinence you might use a catheter to empty your bladder a catheter is a thin tube you can learn to insert through the urethra into the bladder to drain urine you may use a catheter once in a while a few times a day or all of the time if you use the catheter all the time it will drain urine from your bladder into a bag you can hang from your leg if you use a catheter all the time you should watch for possible infections"

information,what is are gastritis ,"gastritis is a condition in which the stomachliningknown as the mucosais inflamed or swollen the stomach lining contains glands that produce stomach acid and an enzyme called pepsin the stomach acid breaks down food and pepsin digests protein a thick layer of mucus coats the stomach lining and helps prevent the acidic digestive juice from dissolving the stomach tissue when the stomach lining is inflamed it produces less acid and fewer enzymes however the stomach lining also produces less mucus and other substances that normally protect the stomach lining from acidic digestive juice
                
gastritis may be acute or chronic
                
 acute gastritis starts suddenly and lasts for a short time   chronic gastritis is long lasting if chronic gastritis is not treated it may last for years or even a lifetime
                
gastritis can be erosive or nonerosive
                
 erosive gastritis can cause the stomach lining to wear away causing erosionsshallow breaks in the stomach liningor ulcersdeep sores in the stomach lining   nonerosive gastritis causes inflammation in the stomach lining however erosions or ulcers do not accompany nonerosive gastritis
                
a health care provider may refer a person with gastritis to a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases"
causes,what causes autoimmune hepatitis ,a combination of autoimmunity environmental triggers and a genetic predisposition can lead to autoimmune hepatitis
symptoms,what are the symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis ,"the most common symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis are
                
 fatigue   joint pain   nausea   loss of appetite   pain or discomfort over the liver   skin rashes   dark yellow urine   lightcolored stools   jaundice or yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes
                
symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis range from mild to severe some people may feel as if they have a mild case of the flu others may have no symptoms when a health care provider diagnoses the disease however they can develop symptoms later"
exams and tests,how to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis ,"a health care provider will make a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis based on symptoms a physical exam blood tests and a liver biopsy
                
a health care provider performs a physical exam and reviews the persons health history including the use of alcohol and medications that can harm the liver a person usually needs blood tests for an exact diagnosis because a person with autoimmune hepatitis can have the same symptoms as those of other liver diseases or metabolic disorders
                
blood tests a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis a person will need blood tests for autoantibodies to help distinguish autoimmune hepatitis from other liver diseases that have similar symptoms such as viral hepatitis primary biliary cirrhosis steatohepatitis or wilson disease
                
liver biopsy a liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease the health care provider may ask the patient to temporarily stop taking certain medications before the liver biopsy he or she may also ask the patient to fast for  hours before the procedure
                
during the procedure the patient lies on a table right hand resting above the head a health care provider will apply a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle if needed he or she will give sedatives and pain medication then he or she will use a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue and may use ultrasound computerized tomography scans or other imaging techniques to guide the needle after the biopsy the patient must lie on the right side for up to  hours and is monitored an additional  to  hours before being sent home
                
a health care provider performs a liver biopsy at a hospital or an outpatient center the liver sample is sent to a pathology lab where the pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseaselooks at the tissue with a microscope and sends a report to the patients health care provider
                
a health care provider can use liver biopsy to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis and determine if cirrhosis is present people often have cirrhosis at the time they are diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis a health care provider can also use liver biopsy to look for changes in the severity of liver damage prior to ending treatment for autoimmune hepatitis"
causes,what causes dumping syndrome ,dumping syndrome is caused by problems with the storage of food particles in the stomach and emptying of particles into the duodenum early dumping syndrome results from rapid movement of fluid into the intestine following a sudden addition of a large amount of food from the stomach late dumping syndrome results from rapid movement of sugar into the intestine which raises the bodys blood glucose level and causes the pancreas to increase its release of the hormone insulin the increased release of insulin causes a rapid drop in blood glucose levels a condition known as hypoglycemia or low blood sugar
information,what is are kidney dysplasia ,"kidney dysplasia is a condition in which the internal structures of one or both of a fetus kidneys do not develop normally while in the womb during normal development two thin tubes of muscle called ureters grow into the kidneys and branch out to form a network of tiny structures called tubules the tubules collect urine as the fetus grows in the womb in kidney dysplasia the tubules fail to branch out completely urine that would normally flow through the tubules has nowhere to go urine collects inside the affected kidney and forms fluidfilled sacs called cysts the cysts replace normal kidney tissue and prevent the kidney from functioning
                
kidney dysplasia can affect one kidney or both kidneys babies with severe kidney dysplasia affecting both kidneys generally do not survive birth those who do survive may need the following early in life
                
 bloodfiltering treatments called dialysis   a kidney transplant
                
children with dysplasia in only one kidney have normal kidney function if the other kidney is unaffected those with mild dysplasia of both kidneys may not need dialysis or a kidney transplant for several years
                
kidney dysplasia is also called renal dysplasia or multicystic dysplastic kidney"
treatment,what are the treatments for diabetes heart disease and stroke ,"you can keep track of the abcs of diabetes to make sure your treatment is working talk with your health care provider about the best targets for you
                
a stands for  a test that measures blood glucose control have an  test at least twice a year it shows your average blood glucose level over the past  months talk with your doctor about whether you should check your blood glucose at home and how to do it
                
 target        below  percent unless your doctor sets a different target

diarrhea of any duration may cause dehydration which means the body lacks enough fluid and electrolyteschemicals in salts including sodium potassium and chlorideto function properly loose stools contain more fluid and electrolytes and weigh more than solid stools
                
people of all ages can get diarrhea in the united states adults average one bout of acute diarrhea each  and young children have an average of two episodes of acute diarrhea each "
exams and tests,how to diagnose diarrhea ,"if acute diarrhea lasts  days or less diagnostic tests are usually not necessary if diarrhea lasts longer or is accompanied by symptoms such as fever or bloody stools a doctor may perform tests to determine the cause
                
diagnostic tests to find the cause of diarrhea may include the following
                
 medical history and physical examination the doctor will ask about eating habits and medication use and will perform a physical examination to look for signs of illness   stool culture a sample of stool is analyzed in a laboratory to check for bacteria parasites or other signs of disease and infection   blood tests blood tests can be helpful in ruling out certain diseases   fasting tests to find out if a food intolerance or allergy is causing the diarrhea the doctor may ask a person to avoid foods with lactose carbohydrates wheat or other ingredients to see whether the diarrhea responds to a change in diet   sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy these tests may be used to look for signs of intestinal diseases that cause chronic diarrhea for sigmoidoscopy the doctor uses a thin flexible lighted tube with a lens on the end to look at the inside of the rectum and lower part of the colon colonoscopy is similar to sigmoidoscopy but it allows the doctor to view the entire colon"
complications,what are the complications of biliary atresia ,"after the kasai procedure some infants continue to have liver problems and even with the return of bile flow some infants develop cirrhosis possible complications after the kasai procedure include ascites bacterial cholangitis portal hypertension and pruritus
                
ascites problems with liver function can cause fluid to build up in the abdomen called ascites ascites can lead to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis a serious infection that requires immediate medical attention ascites usually only lasts a few weeks if ascites lasts more than  weeks cirrhosis is likely present and the infant will probably need a liver transplant
                
bacterial cholangitis bacterial cholangitis is an infection of the bile ducts that is treated with bacteriafighting medications called antibiotics
                
portal hypertension the portal vein carries blood from the stomach intestines spleen gallbladder and pancreas to the liver in cirrhosis scar tissue partially blocks and slows the normal flow of blood which increases the pressure in the portal vein this condition is called portal hypertension portal hypertension can cause gastrointestinal bleeding that may require surgery and an eventual liver transplant
                
pruritus pruritus is caused by bile buildup in the blood and irritation of nerve endings in the skin prescription medication may be recommended for pruritus including resins that bind bile in the intestines and antihistamines that decrease the skins sensation of itching"
considerations,what to do for biliary atresia ,"infants with biliary atresia often have nutritional deficiencies and require special diets as they grow up they may need a higher calorie diet because biliary atresia leads to a faster metabolism the disease also prevents them from digesting fats and can lead to protein and vitamin deficiencies vitamin supplements may be recommended along with adding mediumchain triglyceride oil to foods liquids and infant formula the oil adds calories and is easier to digest without bile than other types of fats if an infant or child is too sick to eat a feeding tube may be recommended to provide highcalorie liquid meals
                
after a liver transplant most infants and children can go back to their usual diet vitamin supplements may still be needed because the medications used to keep the body from rejecting the new liver can affect calcium and magnesium levels"
information,what is are pyelonephritis kidney infection ,pyelonephritis is a type of urinary tract infection uti that affects one or both kidneys
complications,what are the complications of pyelonephritis kidney infection ,"most people with pyelonephritis do not have complications if appropriately treated with bacteriafighting medications called antibiotics
                
in rare cases pyelonephritis may cause permanent kidney scars which can lead to chronic kidney disease high blood pressure and kidney failure these problems usually occur in people with a structural problem in the urinary tract kidney disease from other causes or repeated episodes of pyelonephritis
                
infection in the kidneys may spread to the bloodstreama serious condition called sepsisthough this is also uncommon"

causes,what causes primary sclerosing cholangitis ,"the causes of psc are not known genes immune system problems bacteria and viruses may play roles in the development of the disease
                
psc is linked to inflammatory bowel disease ibd about three out of four people with psc have a type of ibd called ulcerative colitis the link between psc and ibd is not yet understood"
information,what is are kidney failure eat right to feel right on hemodialysis ,"you already know you need to watch how much you drink any food that is liquid at room temperature also contains water these foods include soup jello and ice cream many fruits and vegetables contain lots of water too they include melons grapes apples oranges tomatoes lettuce and celery all these foods add to your fluid intake
                
fluid can build up between dialysis sessions causing swelling and weight gain the extra fluid affects your blood pressure and can make your heart work harder you could have serious heart trouble from overloading your system with fluid
                
control your thirst   the best way to reduce fluid intake is to reduce thirst caused by the salt you eat avoid salty foods like chips and pretzels choose lowsodium products   you can keep your fluids down by drinking from smaller cups or glasses freeze juice in an ice cube tray and eat it like a popsicle remember to count the popsicle in your fluid allowance the dietitian will be able to give you other tips for managing your thirst
                
your dry weight is your weight after a dialysis session when all of the extra fluid in your body has been removed if you let too much fluid build up between sessions it is harder to get down to your proper dry weight your dry weight may change over a period of  to  weeks talk with your doctor regularly about what your dry weight should be
                
my dry weight should be 
                
talk with a dietitian   even though you are on hemodialysis your kidneys may still be able to remove some fluid or your kidneys may not remove any fluid at all that is why every patient has a different daily allowance for fluid talk with your dietitian about how much fluid you can have each day   i can have  ounces of fluid each day   plan  day of fluid servings   i can have  ounces of  with breakfast   i can have  ounces of  in the morning   i can have  ounces of  with lunch   i can have  ounces of  in the afternoon   i can have  ounces of  with supper   i can have  ounces of  in the evening   total  ounces should equal the allowance written above"
causes,what causes viral gastroenteritis ,"four types of viruses cause most cases of viral gastroenteritis
                
rotavirus
                
rotavirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis among infants and young children rotavirus infections are most common in infants  to  months old symptoms usually appear  to  days after exposure rotavirus typically causes vomiting and watery diarrhea for  to  days along with fever and abdominal pain rotavirus can also infect adults who are in close contact with infected children but the symptoms in adults are milder
                
caliciviruses
                
caliciviruses cause infection in people of all ages norovirus is the most common calicivirus and the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in adults norovirus is usually responsible for epidemics of viral gastroenteritis norovirus outbreaks occur all year but are more frequent from october to april people infected with norovirus typically experience nausea vomiting diarrhea abdominal cramps fatigue headache and muscle aches the symptoms usually appear  to  days after exposure to the virus and last for  to  days

viral gastroenteritis is often mistakenly called stomach flu but it is not caused by the influenza virus some forms of gastroenteritis are caused by bacteria or parasites rather than viruses more information about bacterial infections is provided in the niddk health topic foodborne illnesses fact sheet from the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases niddk"
complications,what are the complications of mineral and bone disorder in chronic kidney disease ,"the complications of mineral and bone disorder in ckd include slowed bone growth and deformities and heart and blood vessel problems
                
slowed bone growth and deformities
                
damaged kidneys must work harder to clear phosphorus from the body high levels of phosphorus cause lower levels of calcium in the blood resulting in the following series of events
                
 when a persons blood calcium level becomes too low the parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone   parathyroid hormone removes calcium from bones and places it into the blood raising a persons blood calcium level at the risk of harming bones   a low calcitriol level also leads to an increased level of parathyroid hormone
                
if mineral and bone disorder in ckd remains untreated in adults bones gradually become thin and weak and a person with the condition may begin to feel bone and joint pain mineral and bone disorder in ckd also increases a persons risk of bone fractures
                
heart and blood vessel problems
                
in addition to harming bones mineral and bone disorder in ckd can cause problems in the heart and blood vessels
                
 high levels of blood calcium can damage blood vessels and lead to heart problems   high phosphorus levels also can cause blood vessels to become like bone leading to hardening of the arteries   high phosphorus levels also cause abnormal hormone regulation even if the calcium level is acceptable
                
parathyroid hormone and another hormone made in the bones called  can also affect bone and heart health leading to the following series of problems
                
 when parathyroid hormone or  levels are high a person can have heart problems    the complex hormone abnormalities that cause bone deformities can also harm a persons heart and blood vessels"
information,what is are zollingerellison syndrome ,"zollingerellison syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs when one or more tumors form in the pancreas and duodenum the tumors called gastrinomas release large amounts of gastrin that cause the stomach to produce large amounts of acid normally the body releases small amounts of gastrin after eating which triggers the stomach to make gastric acid that helps break down food and liquid in the stomach the extra acid causes peptic ulcers to form in the duodenum and elsewhere in the upper intestine
                
the tumors seen with zollingerellison syndrome are sometimes cancerous and may spread to other areas of the body"
causes,what causes zollingerellison syndrome ,"experts do not know the exact cause of zollingerellison syndrome about  to  percent of gastrinomas are caused by an inherited genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type    causes hormonereleasing tumors in the endocrine glands and the duodenum symptoms of  include increased hormone levels in the blood kidney stones diabetes muscle weakness weakened bones and fractures

considerations,what to do for zollingerellison syndrome ,researchers have not found that eating diet and nutrition play a role in causing or preventing zollingerellison syndrome
considerations,what to do for facing the challenges of chronic kidney disease in children ,"for children with ckd learning about nutrition is vital because their diet can affect how well their kidneys work parents or guardians should always consult with their childs health care team before making any dietary changes staying healthy with ckd requires paying close attention to the following elements of a diet
                
 protein children with ckd should eat enough protein for growth while limiting high protein intake too much protein can put an extra burden on the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster protein needs increase when a child is on dialysis because the dialysis process removes protein from the childs blood the health care team recommends the amount of protein needed for the child foods with protein include       eggs     milk     cheese     chicken     fish     red meats     beans     yogurt     cottage cheese     sodium the amount of sodium children need depends on the stage of their kidney disease their age and sometimes other factors the health care team may recommend limiting or adding sodium and salt to the diet foods high in sodium include       canned foods     some frozen foods     most processed foods     some snack foods such as chips and crackers     potassium potassium levels need to stay in the normal range for children with ckd because too little or too much potassium can cause heart and muscle problems children may need to stay away from some fruits and vegetables or reduce the number of servings and portion sizes to make sure they do not take in too much potassium the health care team recommends the amount of potassium a child needs lowpotassium fruits and vegetables include       apples     cranberries     strawberries     blueberries     raspberries     pineapple     cabbage     boiled cauliflower     mustard greens     uncooked broccoli   highpotassium fruits and vegetables include       oranges     melons     apricots     bananas     potatoes     tomatoes     sweet potatoes     cooked spinach     cooked broccoli     phosphorus children with ckd need to control the level of phosphorus in their blood because too much phosphorus pulls calcium from the bones making them weaker and more likely to break too much phosphorus also can cause itchy skin and red eyes as ckd progresses a child may need to take a phosphate binder with meals to lower the concentration of phosphorus in the blood phosphorus is found in highprotein foods foods with low levels of phosphorus include       liquid nondairy creamer     green beans     popcorn     unprocessed meats from a butcher     lemonlime soda     root beer     powdered iced tea and lemonade mixes     rice and corn cereals     egg whites     sorbet     fluids early in ckd a childs damaged kidneys may produce either too much or too little urine which can lead to swelling or dehydration as ckd progresses children may need to limit fluid intake the health care provider will tell the child and parents or guardians the goal for fluid intake

causes,what causes cushings syndrome ,"cushings syndrome occurs when the bodys tissues are exposed to high levels of cortisol for too long many people develop cushings syndrome because they take glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolsuch as prednisone for asthma rheumatoid arthritis lupus and other inflammatory diseases glucocorticoids are also used to suppress the immune system after transplantation to keep the body from rejecting the new organ or tissue
                
other people develop cushings syndrome because their bodies produce too much cortisol normally the production of cortisol follows a precise chain of events first the hypothalamus a part of the brain about the size of a small sugar cube sends corticotropinreleasing hormone crh to the pituitary gland crh causes the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropin hormone acth which stimulates the adrenal glands when the adrenals which are located just above the kidneys receive the acth they respond by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream
                
cortisol performs vital tasks in the body including
                
 helping maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function   reducing the immune systems inflammatory response   balancing the effects of insulin which breaks down glucose for energy   regulating the metabolism of proteins carbohydrates and fats
                
one of cortisols most important jobs is to help the body respond to stress for this reason women in their last  months of pregnancy and highly trained athletes normally have high levels of the hormone people suffering from depression alcoholism malnutrition or panic disorders also have increased cortisol levels
                
when the amount of cortisol in the blood is adequate the hypothalamus and pituitary release less crh and acth this process ensures the amount of cortisol released by the adrenal glands is precisely balanced to meet the bodys daily needs however if something goes wrong with the adrenals or the regulating switches in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus cortisol production can go awry
                
pituitary adenomas
                
pituitary adenomas cause  percent of cushings syndrome  excluding those caused by glucocorticoid use these benign or noncancerous tumors of the pituitary gland secrete extra acth most people with the disorder have a single adenoma this form of the syndrome known as cushings disease affects women five times more often than men
                
ectopic acth syndrome
                
some benign or more often cancerous tumors that arise outside the pituitary can produce acth this condition is known as ectopic acth syndrome lung tumors cause more than half of these cases and men are affected three times more often than women the most common forms of acthproducing tumors are small cell lung cancer which accounts for about  percent of all lung cancer  and carcinoid tumorssmall slowgrowing tumors that arise from hormoneproducing cells in various parts of the body other less common types of tumors that can produce acth are thymomas pancreatic islet cell tumors and medullary carcinomas of the thyroid
                
adrenal tumors
                
in rare cases an abnormality of the adrenal glands most often an adrenal tumor causes cushings syndrome adrenal tumors are four to five times more common in women than men and the average age of onset is about  most of these cases involve noncancerous tumors of adrenal tissue called adrenal adenomas which release excess cortisol into the blood
                
adrenocortical carcinomasadrenal cancersare the least common cause of cushings syndrome with adrenocortical carcinomas cancer cells secrete excess levels of several adrenocortical hormones including cortisol and adrenal androgens a type of male hormone adrenocortical carcinomas usually cause very high hormone levels and rapid development of symptoms
                
familial cushings syndrome
                
most cases of cushings syndrome are not inherited rarely however cushings syndrome results from an inherited tendency to develop tumors of one or more endocrine glands endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream with primary pigmented micronodular adrenal disease children or young adults develop small cortisolproducing tumors of the adrenal glands with multiple endocrine neoplasia type   hormonesecreting tumors of the parathyroid glands pancreas and pituitary develop cushings syndrome in  may be due to pituitary ectopic or adrenal tumors"

inflammation is swelling that occurs when tissues of the body become injured or infected inflammation can cause organs to not work properly"
treatment,what are the treatments for what i need to know about hepatitis c ,"hepatitis c is usually not treated unless it becomes chronic chronic hepatitis c is treated with medicines that slow or stop the virus from damaging the liver your doctor will closely watch your symptoms and schedule regular blood tests to make sure the treatment is working
                
medicines for chronic hepatitis c
                
chronic hepatitis c is most often treated with a medicine combination that attacks the hepatitis c virus treatment may last from  to  weeks
                
today newer treatments with medicine for chronic hepatitis c are appearing quickly talk with your doctor if you have questions about treatment
                
talk with your doctor before taking other prescription medicines and overthecounter medicines
                

                
liver transplant
                
a liver transplant may be necessary if chronic hepatitis c causes severe liver damage that leads to liver failure symptoms of severe liver damage include the symptoms of hepatitis c and
                
 generalized itching   a longer than usual amount of time for bleeding to stop   easy bruising   swollen stomach or ankles   spiderlike blood vessels called spider angiomas that develop on the skin
                
liver transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or injured liver and replace it with a healthy one from another person called a donor if your doctors tell you that you need a transplant you should talk with them about the longterm demands of living with a liver transplant
                
a team of surgeonsdoctors who specialize in surgeryperforms a liver transplant in a hospital you will learn how to take care of yourself after you go home and about the medicines youll need to take to protect your new liver you will continue to take medicines because hepatitis c may come back after surgery
                
testing for liver cancer
                
having hepatitis c increases your risk for liver cancer so your doctor may suggest an ultrasound test of the liver every  to  months finding cancer early makes it more treatable ultrasound is a machine that uses sound waves to create a picture of your liver ultrasound is performed at a hospital or radiology center by a specially trained technician the image called a sonogram can show the livers size and the presence of cancerous tumors"
considerations,what to do for what i need to know about hepatitis b ,if you have chronic hepatitis b you should do things to take care of yourself including eating a healthy diet avoid drinking alcohol which can harm the liver talk with your doctor before taking vitamins and other supplements
treatment,what are the treatments for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ,"currently no specific therapies for nash exist the most important recommendations given to persons with this disease are to
                
 reduce their weight if obese or overweight   follow a balanced and healthy diet   increase physical activity   avoid alcohol   avoid unnecessary medications
                
these are standard recommendations but they can make a difference they are also helpful for other conditions such as heart disease diabetes and high cholesterol
                
a major attempt should be made to lower body weight into the healthy range weight loss can improve liver tests in patients with nash and may reverse the disease to some extent research at present is focusing on how much weight loss improves the liver in patients with nash and whether this improvement lasts over a period of time
                
people with nash often have other medical conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol these conditions should be treated with medication and adequately controlled having nash or elevated liver enzymes should not lead people to avoid treating these other conditions
                
experimental approaches under evaluation in patients with nash include antioxidants such as vitamin e selenium and betaine these medications act by reducing the oxidative stress that appears to increase inside the liver in patients with nash whether these substances actually help treat the disease is not known but the results of clinical trials should become available in the next few years
                
another experimental approach to treating nash is the use of newer antidiabetic medicationseven in persons without diabetes most patients with nash have insulin resistance meaning that the insulin normally present in the bloodstream is less effective for them in controlling blood glucose and fatty acids in the blood than it is for people who do not have nash the newer antidiabetic medications make the body more sensitive to insulin and may help reduce liver injury in patients with nash studies of these medicationsincluding metformin rosiglitazone and pioglitazoneare being sponsored by the national institutes of health and should answer the question of whether these medications are beneficial in nash"

causes,what causes short bowel syndrome ,"the main cause of short bowel syndrome is surgery to remove a portion of the small intestine this surgery can treat intestinal diseases injuries or birth defects
                
some children are born with an abnormally short small intestine or with part of their bowel missing which can cause short bowel syndrome in infants short bowel syndrome most commonly occurs following surgery to treat necrotizing enterocolitis a condition in which part of the tissue in the intestines is 
                
short bowel syndrome may also occur following surgery to treat conditions such as
                
 cancer and damage to the intestines caused by cancer treatment   crohns disease a disorder that causes inflammation or swelling and irritation of any part of the digestive tract   gastroschisis which occurs when the intestines stick out of the body through one side of the umbilical cord   internal hernia which occurs when the small intestine is displaced into pockets in the abdominal lining   intestinal atresia which occurs when a part of the intestines doesnt form completely   intestinal injury from loss of blood flow due to a blocked blood vessel   intestinal injury from trauma   intussusception in which one section of either the large or small intestine folds into itself much like a collapsible telescope   meconium ileus which occurs when the meconium a newborns first stool is thicker and stickier than normal and blocks the ileum   midgut volvulus which occurs when blood supply to the middle of the small intestine is completely cut off   omphalocele which occurs when the intestines liver or other organs stick out through the navel or belly button
                
even if a person does not have surgery disease or injury can damage the small intestine"
frequency,how many people are affected by short bowel syndrome ,short bowel syndrome is a rare condition each year short bowel syndrome affects about three out of every million 
susceptibility,who is at risk for liver hepatocellular cancer ,having hepatitis or cirrhosis can increase the risk of developing liver cancer anything that increases the chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer people who think they may be at risk should discuss this with their doctor risk factors for liver cancer include          having hepatitis b or hepatitis c having both hepatitis b and hepatitis c increases the risk even more     having cirrhosis which can be caused by                  hepatitis especially hepatitis c or       drinking large amounts of alcohol for many years or being an alcoholic              eating foods tainted with aflatoxin poison from a fungus that can grow on foods such as grains and nuts that have not been stored properly
prevention,how to prevent ovarian epithelial fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer ,women with an increased risk of ovarian cancer may consider surgery to lessen the risk some women who have an increased risk of ovarian cancer may choose to have a riskreducing oophorectomy the removal of healthy ovaries so that cancer cannot grow in them in highrisk women this procedure has been shown to greatly decrease the risk of ovarian cancer see the pdq summary on ovarian fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer prevention for more information
susceptibility,who is at risk for hypopharyngeal cancer ,use of tobacco products and heavy drinking can affect the risk of developing hypopharyngeal cancer anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk risk factors include the following          smoking tobacco     chewing tobacco     heavy alcohol use     eating a diet without enough nutrients     having plummervinson syndrome

stages,what are the stages of aidsrelated lymphoma ,"key points
                     after aidsrelated lymphoma has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body      there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body     stages of aidsrelated lymphoma may include e and s     the following stages are used for aidsrelated lymphoma          stage i      stage ii      stage iii      stage iv         for treatment aidsrelated lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body as follows          peripheralsystemic lymphoma      primary cns lymphoma
                
                
                    after aidsrelated lymphoma has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body
                    the process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment but aidsrelated lymphoma is usually advanced when it is diagnosed    the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process            blood chemistry studies  a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body an unusual higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of disease the blood sample will be checked for the level of ldh lactate dehydrogenase        ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as the lung lymph nodes and liver taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography       pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do       mri magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium  a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body a substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein the gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri       lumbar puncture  a procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid csf from the spinal column this is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the csf around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid the sample of csf is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord the sample may also be checked for epsteinbarr virus this procedure is also called an lp or spinal tap
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body
                    cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood          tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas      lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body      blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body
                
                
                    stages of aidsrelated lymphoma may include e and s
                    aidsrelated lymphoma may be described as follows          e e stands for extranodal and means the cancer is found in an area or organ other than the lymph nodes or has spread to tissues beyond but near the major lymphatic areas     s s stands for spleen and means the cancer is found in the spleen
                
                
                    the following stages are used for aidsrelated lymphoma
                    stage i      stage i aidsrelated lymphoma is divided into stage i and stage ie               stage i cancer is found in one lymphatic area lymph node group tonsils and nearby tissue thymus or spleen       stage ie cancer is found in one organ or area outside the lymph nodes              stage ii     stage ii aidsrelated lymphoma is divided into stage ii and stage iie               stage ii cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen       stage iie cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm cancer is also found outside the lymph nodes in one organ or area on the same side of the diaphragm as the affected lymph nodes              stage iii      stage iii aidsrelated lymphoma is divided into stage iii stage iiie stage iiis and stage iiies               stage iii cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen       stage iiie cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area       stage iiis cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and in the spleen       stage iiies cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area and in the spleen              stage iv     in stage iv aidsrelated lymphoma the cancer              is found throughout one or more organs that are not part of a lymphatic area lymph node group tonsils and nearby tissue thymus or spleen and may be in lymph nodes near those organs or      is found in one organ that is not part of a lymphatic area and has spread to organs or lymph nodes far away from that organ or      is found in the liver bone marrow cerebrospinal fluid csf or lungs other than cancer that has spread to the lungs from nearby areas           patients who are infected with the epsteinbarr virus or whose aidsrelated lymphoma affects the bone marrow have an increased risk of the cancer spreading to the central nervous system cns
                
                
                    for treatment aidsrelated lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body as follows
                    peripheralsystemic lymphoma     lymphoma that starts in the lymph system or elsewhere in the body other than the brain is called peripheralsystemic lymphoma it may spread throughout the body including to the brain or bone marrow it is often diagnosed in an advanced stage        primary cns lymphoma     primary cns lymphoma starts in the central nervous system brain and spinal cord it is linked to the epsteinbarr virus lymphoma that starts somewhere else in the body and spreads to the central nervous system is not primary cns lymphoma"
information,what is are chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ,"key points
                     chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a disease in which too many myelocytes and monocytes immature white blood cells are made in the bone marrow     older age and being male increase the risk of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia     signs and symptoms of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia include fever weight loss and feeling very tired     certain factors affect prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options
                
                
                    chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a disease in which too many myelocytes and monocytes immature white blood cells are made in the bone marrow
                    in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cmml the body tells too many blood stem cells to become two types of white blood cells called myelocytes and monocytes some of these blood stem cells never become mature white blood cells these immature white blood cells are called blasts over time the myelocytes monocytes and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow when this happens infection anemia or easy bleeding may occur"
outlook,what is the outlook for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ,certain factors affect prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options the prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options for cmml depend on the following          the number of white blood cells or platelets in the blood or bone marrow     whether the patient is anemic     the amount of blasts in the blood or bone marrow     the amount of hemoglobin in red blood cells     whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes
susceptibility,who is at risk for nasopharyngeal cancer ,ethnic background and being exposed to the epsteinbarr virus can affect the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk risk factors for nasopharyngeal cancer include the following          having chinese or asian ancestry     being exposed to the epsteinbarr virus the epsteinbarr virus has been associated with certain cancers including nasopharyngeal cancer and some lymphomas     drinking large amounts of alcohol
treatment,what are the treatments for nasopharyngeal cancer ,"key points
                     there are different types of treatment for patients with nasopharyngeal cancer      three types of standard treatment are used          radiation therapy       chemotherapy       surgery          new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials      patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with nasopharyngeal cancer
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with nasopharyngeal cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    three types of standard treatment are used
                    radiation therapy      radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy              external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue these types of radiation therapy include the following                     intensitymodulated radiation therapy imrt imrt is a type of   radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor thin beams of radiation of different intensities strengths are aimed at the tumor from many angles compared to standard radiation therapy intensitymodulated radiation therapy may be less likely to cause dry mouth         stereotactic radiation therapy a rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment a machine aims radiation directly at the tumor the total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days this procedure is also called stereotactic externalbeam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy                  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer    external radiation therapy to the thyroid or the pituitary gland may change the way the thyroid gland works a blood test to check the thyroid hormone level in the blood is done before and after therapy to make sure the thyroid gland is working properly it is also important that a dentist check the patients teeth gums and mouth and fix any existing problems before radiation therapy begins       chemotherapy      chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated     chemotherapy may be given after radiation therapy to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after radiation therapy to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy    see drugs approved for head and neck cancer for more information nasopharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer       surgery      surgery is a procedure to find out whether cancer is present to remove cancer from the body or to repair a body part also called an operation surgery is sometimes used for nasopharyngeal cancer that does not respond to radiation therapy if cancer has spread to the lymph nodes the doctor may remove lymph nodes and other tissues in the neck
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    information about clinical trials is available from the nci website
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

                     a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor is cancer that forms in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract       health history can affect the risk of gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors      some gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors have no signs or symptoms in the early stages       carcinoid syndrome may occur if the tumor spreads to the liver or other parts of the body      imaging studies and tests that examine the blood and urine are used to detect find and diagnose gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors     certain factors affect prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options
                
                
                    a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor is cancer that forms in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract
                    the gastrointestinal gi tract is part of the bodys digestive system it helps to digest food takes nutrients vitamins minerals carbohydrates fats proteins and water from food to be used by the body and helps pass waste material out of the body the gi tract is made up of these and other organs           stomach      small intestine duodenum jejunum and ileum      colon      rectum          gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors form from a certain type of neuroendocrine cell a type of cell that is like a nerve cell and a hormone making cell these cells are scattered throughout the chest and abdomen but most are found in the gi tract neuroendocrine cells make hormones that help control digestive juices and the muscles used in moving food through the stomach and intestines a gi carcinoid tumor may also make hormones and release them into the body   gi carcinoid tumors are rare and most grow very slowly most of them occur in the small intestine rectum and appendix sometimes more than one tumor will form    see the following pdq summaries for more information related to gi and other types of carcinoid tumors           nonsmall cell lung cancer treatment      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors islet cell tumors treatment       rectal cancer treatment      small intestine cancer treatment      unusual cancers of childhood treatment
                
                
                    carcinoid syndrome may occur if the tumor spreads to the liver or other parts of the body
                    the hormones made by gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors are usually destroyed by liver enzymes in the blood if the tumor has spread to the liver and the liver enzymes cannot destroy the extra hormones made by the tumor high amounts of these hormones may remain in the body and cause carcinoid syndrome this can also happen if tumor cells enter the blood signs and symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include the following          redness or a feeling of warmth in the face and neck      abdominal pain     feeling bloated     diarrhea     wheezing or other trouble breathing     fast heartbeat        these signs and symptoms may be caused by gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors or by other conditions talk to your doctor if you have any of these signs or symptoms"
exams and tests,how to diagnose gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors ,imaging studies and tests that examine the blood and urine are used to detect find and diagnose gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors the following tests and procedures may be used            physical exam and history  an exam of the body to check general signs of health including checking for signs of disease such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken        blood chemistry studies  a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances such as hormones released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body an unusual higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of disease the blood sample is checked to see if it contains a hormone produced by carcinoid tumors this test is used to help diagnose carcinoid syndrome        tumor marker test  a procedure in which a sample of blood urine or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances such as chromogranin a made by organs tissues or tumor cells in the body chromogranin a is a tumor marker it has been linked to neuroendocrine tumors when found in increased levels in the body       twentyfourhour urine test a test in which urine is collected for  hours to measure the amounts of certain substances such as  or serotonin hormone an unusual higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it this test is used to help diagnose carcinoid syndrome      mibg scan  a procedure used to find neuroendocrine tumors such as carcinoid tumors a very small amount of radioactive material called mibg metaiodobenzylguanidine is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream carcinoid tumors take up the radioactive material and are detected by a device that measures radiation       ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography        mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging        pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells       endoscopic ultrasound eus a procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body usually through the mouth or rectum an endoscope is a thin tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing a probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce highenergy sound waves ultrasound off internal tissues or organs such as the stomach small intestine colon or rectum and make echoes the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram this procedure is also called endosonography        upper endoscopy  a procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas an endoscope is inserted through the mouth and passed through the esophagus into the stomach sometimes the endoscope also is passed from the stomach into the small intestine an endoscope is a thin tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing it may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease        colonoscopy  a procedure to look inside the rectum and colon for polyps abnormal areas or cancer a colonoscope is inserted through the rectum into the colon a colonoscope is a thin tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing it may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer       capsule endoscopy  a procedure used to see all of the small intestine the patient swallows a capsule that contains a tiny camera as the capsule moves through the gastrointestinal tract the camera takes pictures and sends them to a receiver worn on the outside of the body        biopsy  the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer tissue samples may be taken during endoscopy and colonoscopy
outlook,what is the outlook for gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors ,certain factors affect prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options the prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options depend on the following          where the tumor is in the gastrointestinal tract     the size of the tumor      whether the cancer has spread from the stomach and intestines to other parts of the body such as the liver or lymph nodes     whether the patient has carcinoid syndrome or has carcinoid heart syndrome     whether the cancer can be completely removed by surgery      whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred
research,what research or clinical trials is being done for gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors ,"new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials

                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials"

                     retinoblastoma is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the tissues of the retina     retinoblastoma occurs in heritable and nonheritable forms       treatment for both forms of retinoblastoma should include genetic counseling     children with a family history of retinoblastoma should have eye exams to check for retinoblastoma      a child who has heritable retinoblastoma has an increased risk of trilateral retinoblastoma and other cancers     signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma include white pupil and eye pain or redness      tests that examine the retina are used to detect find and diagnose retinoblastoma     certain factors affect prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options
                
                
                    retinoblastoma is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the tissues of the retina
                    the retina is the nerve tissue that lines the inside of the back of the eye the retina senses light and sends images to the brain by way of the optic nerve      although retinoblastoma may occur at any age it occurs most often in children younger than  years the cancer may be in one eye unilateral or in both eyes bilateral retinoblastoma rarely spreads from the eye to nearby tissue or other parts of the body    cavitary retinoblastoma is a rare type of retinoblastoma in which cavities hollow spaces form within the tumor
                
                
                    treatment for both forms of retinoblastoma should include genetic counseling

                     after nonmelanoma skin cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the skin or to other parts of the body      there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body     cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body     staging of nonmelanoma skin cancer depends on whether the tumor has certain highrisk features and if the tumor is on the eyelid     the following stages are used for nonmelanoma skin cancer that is not on the eyelid          stage  carcinoma in situ      stage i stage i nonmelanoma skin cancer the tumor is no more than  centimeters      stage ii stage ii nonmelanoma skin cancer the tumor is more than  centimeters wide      stage iii      stage iv         the following stages are used for nonmelanoma skin cancer on the eyelid          stage  carcinoma in situ      stage i       stage ii      stage iii      stage iv         treatment is based on the type of nonmelanoma skin cancer or other skin condition diagnosed          basal cell carcinoma      squamous cell carcinoma      actinic keratosis
                
                
                    after nonmelanoma skin cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the skin or to other parts of the body
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the skin or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process            ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography       mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri       lymph node biopsy  for squamous cell carcinoma the lymph nodes may be removed and checked to see if cancer has spread to them
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body
                    cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood          tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas      lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body      blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood          lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body     blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if skin cancer spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually skin cancer cells the disease is metastatic skin cancer not lung cancer
                
                
                    staging of nonmelanoma skin cancer depends on whether the tumor has certain highrisk features and if the tumor is on the eyelid
                    staging for nonmelanoma skin cancer that is on the eyelid is different from staging for nonmelanoma skin cancer that affects other parts of the body     the following are highrisk features for nonmelanoma skin cancer that is not on the eyelid          the tumor is thicker than  millimeters     the tumor is described as clark level iv has spread into the lower layer of the dermis or clark level v has spread into the layer of fat below the skin     the tumor has grown and spread along nerve pathways     the tumor began on an ear or on a lip that has hair on it     the tumor has cells that look very different from normal cells under a microscope
                
                
                    the following stages are used for nonmelanoma skin cancer that is not on the eyelid
                    stage  carcinoma in situ     in stage  abnormal cells are found in the squamous cell or basal cell layer of the epidermis topmost layer of the skin these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue stage  is also called carcinoma in situ        stage i     in stage i cancer has formed the tumor is not larger than  centimeters at its widest point and may have one highrisk feature       stage ii     in stage ii the tumor is either             larger than  centimeters at its widest point or      any size and has two or more highrisk features              stage iii    in stage iii             the tumor has spread to the jaw eye socket or side of the skull cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor the lymph node is not larger than  centimeters              or               cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor the lymph node is not larger than  centimeters and one of the following is true                   the tumor is not larger than  centimeters at its widest point and may have one highrisk feature or        the tumor is larger than  centimeters at its widest point or        the tumor is any size and has two or more highrisk features                          stage iv    in stage iv one of the following is true             the tumor is any size and may have spread to the jaw eye socket or side of the skull cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor and the affected node is larger than  centimeters but not larger than  centimeters or cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on one or both sides of the body and the affected nodes are not larger than  centimeters or      the tumor is any size and may have spread to the jaw eye socket skull spine or ribs cancer has spread to one lymph node that is larger than  centimeters or       the tumor is any size and has spread to the base of the skull spine or ribs cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes or      cancer has spread to other parts of the body such as the lung

                     there are different types of treatment for children with ependymoma      children with ependymoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors     childhood brain and spinal cord tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years     some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended     four types of standard treatment are used          surgery       radiation therapy       chemotherapy       observation         new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials      patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for children with ependymoma
                    different types of treatment are available for children with ependymoma some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment   because cancer in children is rare taking part in a clinical trial should be considered some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    children with ependymoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors
                    treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer the pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine these may include the following specialists          pediatric neurosurgeon      neurologist      neuropathologist      neuroradiologist      pediatrician      rehabilitation specialist      radiation oncologist      medical oncologist      endocrinologist      psychologist
                
                
                    childhood brain and spinal cord tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years
                    childhood brain and spinal cord tumors may cause signs or symptoms that continue for months or years signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis signs or symptoms caused by treatment may begin during or right after treatment
                
                
                    some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended
                    these are called late effects late effects of cancer treatment may include the following          physical problems     changes in mood feelings thinking learning or memory      second cancers new types of cancer        some late effects may be treated or controlled it is important to talk with your childs doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information
                
                
                    four types of standard treatment are used
                    surgery     if the results of diagnostic tests show there may be a brain tumor a biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of the brain tissue a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells if cancer cells are found the doctor will remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery        an mri is often done after the tumor is removed to find out whether any tumor remains if tumor remains a second surgery to remove as much of the remaining tumor as possible may be done    even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment to lower the risk that the cancer will come back after surgery is called adjuvant therapy        radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy               external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue these types of radiation therapy include the following                    conformal radiation therapy conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a   picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor         intensitymodulated radiation therapy imrt imrt is a type of   radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor thin beams of radiation of different intensities strengths are aimed at the tumor from many angles         protonbeam radiation therapy protonbeam therapy is a type of highenergy external radiation therapy a radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons tiny invisible positivelycharged particles at the cancer cells to kill them         stereotactic radiosurgery stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy a rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment a machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor this procedure does not involve surgery it is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery radiosurgery and radiation surgery                  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat childhood ependymoma     children younger than  years who receive radiation therapy to the brain have a higher risk of problems with growth and development than older children  conformal radiation therapy and protonbeam therapy are being studied in children younger than  years to see if the effects of radiation on growth and development are lessened       chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated       observation     observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change observation may be used to treat a child with a subependymoma who has no symptoms and whose tumor is found while treating another condition
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    information about clinical trials is available from the nci website
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial

treatment,what are the treatments for childhood vascular tumors ,"key points
                     there are different types of treatment for childhood vascular tumors     children with childhood vascular tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children      some treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended     eleven types of standard treatment are used          betablocker therapy      surgery      photocoagulation      embolization      chemotherapy      sclerotherapy      radiation therapy      targeted therapy      immunotherapy      other drug therapy      observation         new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials     patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for childhood vascular tumors
                    different types of treatment are available for children with vascular tumors some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment   because vascular tumors in children are rare taking part in a clinical trial should be considered some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    children with childhood vascular tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children
                    treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer the pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine these may include the following specialists          pediatric vascular anomaly specialist expert in treating children with vascular tumors      pediatric surgeon      orthopedic surgeon      radiation oncologist      pediatric nurse specialist      rehabilitation specialist      psychologist      social worker
                
                
                    some treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended
                    some treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after treatment has ended these are called late effects late effects of treatment may include          physical problems     changes in mood feelings thinking learning or memory      second cancers new types of cancer        some late effects may be treated or controlled it is important to talk with your childs doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information
                
                
                    eleven types of standard treatment are used
                    betablocker therapy     betablockers are drugs that decrease blood pressure and heart rate when used in patients with vascular tumors betablockers may help shrink the tumors betablocker therapy may be given by vein iv by mouth or placed on the skin topical the way the betablocker therapy is given depends on the type of vascular tumor and where the tumor first formed    the betablocker propranolol is usually the first treatment for hemangiomas infants treated with iv propranolol may need to have their treatment started in a hospital propranolol is also used to treat benign vascular tumor of liver and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma    other betablockers used to treat vascular tumors include atenolol nadolol and timolol     infantile hemangioma may also be treated with propranolol and steroid therapy or propranolol and topical betablocker therapy    see the drug information summary on propranolol hydrochloride for more information       surgery    the following types of surgery may be used to remove many types of vascular tumors               excision surgery to remove the entire tumor and some of the healthy tissue around it       laser surgery a surgical procedure that uses a laser beam a narrow beam of intense light as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a skin lesion such as a tumor surgery with a pulsed dye laser may be used for some hemangiomas this type of laser uses a beam of light that targets blood vessels in the skin the light is changed into heat and the blood vessels are destroyed without damaging nearby skin       total hepatectomy and liver transplant a surgical procedure to remove the entire liver followed by a transplant of a healthy liver from a donor       curettage a procedure in which abnormal tissue is removed using a small spoonshaped instrument called a curette           the type of surgery used depends on the type of vascular tumor and where the tumor formed in the body    for malignant tumors even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the tumor will come back is called adjuvant therapy       photocoagulation     photocoagulation is the use of an intense beam of light such as a laser to seal off blood vessels or destroy tissue it is used to treat pyogenic granuloma       embolization     embolization is a procedure that uses particles such as tiny gelatin sponges or beads to block blood vessels in the liver it may be used to treat some benign vascular tumors of the liver and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma       chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas regional chemotherapy chemotherapy for hemangiomas may also be given topically applied to the skin in a cream or lotion     the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the vascular tumor being treated       sclerotherapy     sclerotherapy is a treatment used to destroy the blood vessel with the tumor a liquid is injected into the blood vessel causing it to scar and break down over time the destroyed blood vessel is absorbed into normal tissue the blood flows through nearby healthy veins instead sclerotherapy is used in the treatment of epithelioid hemangioma       radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill tumor cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy               external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the tumor       internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the tumor           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the vascular tumor being treated external radiation is used to treat some vascular tumors       targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific tumor cells targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do angiogenesis inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy             angiogenesis inhibitors are drugs that stop cells from dividing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow the targeted therapy drugs thalidomide sorafenib pazopanib sirolimus and bevacizumab are angiogenesis inhibitors used to treat childhood vascular tumors              immunotherapy     immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight disease substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the bodys natural defenses against disease     interferon is a type of immunotherapy used to treat childhood vascular tumors it interferes with the division of tumor cells and can slow tumor growth it is used in the treatment of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma       other drug therapy    other drugs used to treat childhood vascular tumors or manage their effects include the following              steroid therapy steroids are hormones made naturally in the body they can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs steroid drugs help shrink some vascular tumors       nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids nsaids are commonly used to decrease fever swelling pain and redness examples of nsaids are aspirin ibuprofen and naproxen in the treatment of vascular tumors nsaids can increase the flow of blood through the tumors and decrease the chance that an unwanted blood clot will form        antifibrinolytic therapy these drugs help the blood clot in patients who have kasabachmerritt syndrome fibrin is the main protein in a blood clot that helps stop bleeding and heal wounds some vascular tumors cause fibrin to break down and the patients blood does not clot normally causing uncontrolled bleeding antifibrinolytics help prevent the breakdown of fibrin               observation     observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    information about clinical trials is available from the nci website
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the research process clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way disease will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose tumors have not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop tumors from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed

                     polycythemia vera is a disease in which too many red blood cells are made in the bone marrow     symptoms of polycythemia vera include headaches and a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side     special blood tests are used to diagnose polycythemia vera
                
                
                    polycythemia vera is a disease in which too many red blood cells are made in the bone marrow
                    in polycythemia vera the blood becomes thickened with too many red blood cells the number of white blood cells and platelets may also increase these extra blood cells may collect in the spleen and cause it to swell the increased number of red blood cells white blood cells or platelets in the blood can cause bleeding problems and make clots form in blood vessels this can increase the risk of stroke or heart attack in patients who are older than  years or who have a history of blood clots the risk of stroke or heart attack is higher patients also have an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia or primary myelofibrosis"

                    different types of treatments are available for patients with vulvar cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    four types of standard treatment are used
                    surgery     surgery is the most common treatment for vulvar cancer the goal of surgery is to remove all the cancer without any loss of the womans sexual function one of the following types of surgery may be done              laser surgery a surgical procedure that uses a laser beam a narrow beam of intense light as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor       wide local excision a surgical procedure to remove the cancer and some of the normal tissue around the cancer       radical local excision a surgical procedure to remove the cancer and a large amount of normal tissue around it nearby lymph nodes in the groin may also be removed       ultrasound surgical aspiration usa a surgical procedure to break the tumor up into small pieces using very fine vibrations the small pieces of tumor are washed away and removed by suction this procedure causes less damage to nearby tissue      vulvectomy a surgical procedure to remove part or all of the vulva                    skinning vulvectomy the top layer of vulvar skin where the cancer is found is removed skin grafts from other parts of the body may be needed to cover the area where the skin was removed         modified radical vulvectomy surgery to remove part of the vulva nearby lymph nodes may also be removed         radical vulvectomy surgery to remove the entire vulva nearby lymph nodes are also removed                  pelvic exenteration a surgical procedure to remove the lower colon rectum and bladder the cervix vagina ovaries and nearby lymph nodes are also removed artificial openings stoma are made for urine and stool to flow from the body into a collection bag           even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may have chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy       radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy              external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer       internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat vulvar cancer and external radiation therapy may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life       chemotherapy    chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ a body cavity such as the abdomen or onto the skin the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated     topical chemotherapy for vulvar cancer may be applied to the skin in a cream or lotion     see drugs approved to treat vulvar cancer for more information       biologic therapy     biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy      imiquimod is a biologic therapy that may be used to treat vulvar lesions and is applied to the skin in a cream

                    seven types of standard treatment are used for childhood aml childhood cml jmml or mds
                    chemotherapy      chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid intrathecal chemotherapy an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug     the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated    in aml the leukemia cells may spread to the brain andor spinal cord chemotherapy given by mouth or vein to treat aml may not cross the bloodbrain barrier to get into the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord instead chemotherapy is injected into the fluidfilled space to kill leukemia cells that may have spread there intrathecal chemotherapy       see drugs approved for acute myeloid leukemia for more information       radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy               external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer       internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated in childhood aml external radiation therapy may be used to treat a chloroma that does not respond to chemotherapy       stem cell transplant     stem cell transplant is a way of giving chemotherapy and replacing bloodforming cells that are abnormal or destroyed by the cancer treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored after the chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the bodys blood cells        targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells types of targeted therapy include the following               tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy tyrosine kinase inhibitor tki therapy blocks signals needed for tumors to grow tkis block the enzyme tyrosine kinase that causes stem cells to become more white blood cells granulocytes or blasts than the body needs tkis may be used with other anticancer drugs as adjuvant therapy treatment given after the initial treatment to lower the risk that the cancer will come back                     imatinib is a type of tki that is approved to treat childhood cml          sorafenib dasatinib and nilotinib are being studied in the treatment of childhood leukemia                   monoclonal antibody therapy monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion they may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells                     gemtuzumab is a type of monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of a subtype of aml called acute promyelocytic leukemia apl gemtuzumab is not available in the united states unless special approval is given monoclonal antibodies may be used with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy                   proteasome inhibitor therapy proteasome inhibitors break down proteins in cancer cells and kill them                     bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat childhood apl                      see drugs approved for leukemia for more information       other drug therapy     lenalidomide may be used to lessen the need for transfusions in patients who have myelodysplastic syndromes caused by a specific chromosome change     arsenic trioxide and alltrans retinoic acid atra are anticancer drugs that kill leukemia cells stop the leukemia cells from dividing or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells these drugs are used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia    see drugs approved for acute myeloid leukemia for more information       watchful waiting     watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change it is sometimes used to treat mds or tmd       supportive care     supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment supportive care may include the following              transfusion therapy a way of giving red blood cells white blood cells or platelets to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or cancer treatment the blood may be donated from another person or it may have been taken from the patient earlier and stored until needed       drug therapy such as antibiotics or antifungal agents       leukapheresis a procedure in which a special machine is used to remove white blood cells from the blood blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood cell separator where the white blood cells are removed the rest of the blood is then returned to the patients bloodstream

treatment,what are the treatments for melanoma ,"key points
                     there are different types of treatment for patients with melanoma      five types of standard treatment are used          surgery       chemotherapy       radiation therapy       immunotherapy      targeted therapy         new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials      treatment for melanoma may cause side effects     patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with melanoma
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with melanoma some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    five types of standard treatment are used
                    surgery      surgery to remove the tumor is the primary treatment of all stages of melanoma a wide local excision is used to remove the melanoma and some of the normal tissue around it skin grafting taking skin from another part of the body to replace the skin that is removed may be done to cover the wound caused by surgery     it is important to know whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes lymph node mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy are done to check for cancer in the sentinel lymph node the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor during surgery a radioactive substance andor blue dye is injected near the tumor the substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes the first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells if cancer cells are found more lymph nodes will be removed and tissue samples will be checked for signs of cancer this is called a lymphadenectomy    even if the doctor removes all the melanoma that can be seen at the time of surgery some patients may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left chemotherapy given after surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy    surgery to remove cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes lung gastrointestinal gi tract bone or brain may be done to improve the patients quality of life by controlling symptoms       chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy    one type of regional chemotherapy is hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion with this method anticancer drugs go directly to the arm or leg the cancer is in the flow of blood to and from the limb is temporarily stopped with a tourniquet a warm solution with the anticancer drug is put directly into the blood of the limb this gives a high dose of drugs to the area where the cancer is    the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    see drugs approved for melanoma for more information       radiation therapy      radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy               external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer       internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat melanoma and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life       immunotherapy     immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or biologic therapy     the following types of immunotherapy are being used in the treatment of melanoma              immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy some types of immune cells such as t cells and some cancer cells have certain proteins called checkpoint proteins on their surface that keep immune responses in check when cancer cells have large amounts of these proteins they will not be attacked and killed by t cells immune checkpoint inhibitors block these proteins and the ability of t cells to kill cancer cells is increased they are used to treat some patients with advanced melanoma or tumors that cannot be removed by surgery there are two types of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy                     inhibitor  is a protein on the surface of t cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check when  attaches to another protein called  on a cancer cell it stops the t cell from killing the cancer cell  inhibitors attach to  and allow the t cells to kill cancer cells ipilimumab is a type of  inhibitor          inhibitor  is a protein on the surface of t cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check when  attaches to another protein called  on a cancer cell it stops the t cell from killing the cancer cell  inhibitors attach to  and allow the t cells to kill cancer cells pembrolizumab and nivolumab are types of  inhibitors                  interferon interferon affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth          boosts the growth and activity of many immune cells especially lymphocytes a type of white blood cell lymphocytes can attack and kill cancer cells       tumor necrosis factor tnf therapy tnf is a protein made by white blood cells in response to an antigen or infection tnf is made in the laboratory and used as a treatment to kill cancer cells it is being studied in the treatment of melanoma           see drugs approved for melanoma for more information       targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do the following types of targeted therapy are used or being studied in the treatment of melanoma               signal transduction inhibitor therapy signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell blocking these signals may kill cancer cells                     vemurafenib dabrafenib trametinib and cobimetinib are signal transduction inhibitors used to treat some patients with advanced melanoma or tumors that cannot be removed by surgery vemurafenib and dabrafenib block the activity of proteins made by mutant braf genes trametinib and cobimetinib affect the growth and survival of cancer cells                  oncolytic virus therapy a type of targeted therapy that is used in the treatment of melanoma oncolytic virus therapy uses a virus that infects and breaks down cancer cells but not normal cells radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given after oncolytic virus therapy to kill more cancer cells        angiogenesis inhibitors a type of targeted therapy that is being studied in the treatment of melanoma angiogenesis inhibitors block the growth of new blood vessels in cancer treatment they may be given to prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow            new targeted therapies and combinations of therapies are being studied in the treatment of melanoma    see drugs approved for melanoma for more information

susceptibility,who is at risk for uterine sarcoma ,being exposed to xrays can increase the risk of uterine sarcoma anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk risk factors for uterine sarcoma include the following          past treatment with radiation therapy to the pelvis     treatment with tamoxifen for breast cancer if you are taking this drug have a pelvic exam every year and report any vaginal bleeding other than menstrual bleeding as soon as possible
symptoms,what are the symptoms of uterine sarcoma ,signs of uterine sarcoma include abnormal bleeding abnormal bleeding from the vagina and other signs and symptoms may be caused by uterine sarcoma or by other conditions check with your doctor if you have any of the following          bleeding that is not part of menstrual periods     bleeding after menopause     a mass in the vagina     pain or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen     frequent urination
exams and tests,how to diagnose uterine sarcoma ,tests that examine the uterus are used to detect find and diagnose uterine sarcoma the following tests and procedures may be used            physical exam and history  an exam of the body to check general signs of health including checking for signs of disease such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken      pelvic exam an exam of the vagina cervix uterus fallopian tubes ovaries and rectum a speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease a pap test of the cervix is usually done the doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size shape and position of the uterus and ovaries the doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas      pap test a procedure to collect cells from the surface of the cervix and vagina a piece of cotton a brush or a small wooden stick is used to gently scrape cells from the cervix and vagina the cells are viewed under a microscope to find out if they are abnormal this procedure is also called a pap smear because uterine sarcoma begins inside the uterus this cancer may not show up on the pap test        transvaginal ultrasound exam a procedure used to examine the vagina uterus fallopian tubes and bladder an ultrasound transducer probe is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce highenergy sound waves ultrasound off internal tissues or organs and make echoes the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram the doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram        dilatation and curettage  a procedure to remove samples of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus the cervix is dilated and a curette spoonshaped instrument is inserted into the uterus to remove tissue the tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of disease this procedure is also called a dc       endometrial biopsy  the removal of tissue from the endometrium inner lining of the uterus by inserting a thin flexible tube through the cervix and into the uterus the tube is used to gently scrape a small amount of tissue from the endometrium and then remove the tissue samples a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells
research,what research or clinical trials is being done for metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary ,"new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website     chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy        hyperfractionated radiation therapy     hyperfractionated radiation therapy is a type of external radiation treatment in which a smaller than usual total daily dose of radiation is divided into two doses and the treatments are given twice a day hyperfractionated radiation therapy is given over the same period of time days or weeks as standard radiation therapy
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials"
susceptibility,who is at risk for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma ,certain genetic conditions increase the risk of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk   risk factors for rhabdomyosarcoma include having the following inherited diseases           lifraumeni syndrome      pleuropulmonary blastoma      neurofibromatosis type        costello syndrome      beckwithwiedemann syndrome       noonan syndrome        children who had a high birth weight or were larger than expected at birth may have an increased risk of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma   in most cases the cause of rhabdomyosarcoma is not known
stages,what are the stages of wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors ,"key points
                     wilms tumors are staged during surgery and with imaging tests     there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body     cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body     in addition to the stages wilms tumors are described by their histology     the following stages are used for both favorable histology and anaplastic wilms tumors          stage i      stage ii      stage iii      stage iv      stage v         the treatment of other childhood kidney tumors depends on the tumor type
                
                
                    wilms tumors are staged during surgery and with imaging tests
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread outside of the kidney to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment the doctor will use results of the diagnostic and staging tests to help find out the stage of the disease   the following tests may be done to see if cancer has spread to other places in the body            lymph node biopsy  a surgical procedure in which lymph nodes in the abdomen are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer this procedure is also called lymphadenectomy or lymph node dissection       liver function test  a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver a higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign that the liver is not working as it should       xray of the chest and bones an xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film making a picture of areas inside the body such as the chest        ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as the abdomen pelvis chest and brain taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine a dye is injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography       petct scan  a procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography pet scan and a computed tomography ct scan the pet and ct scans are done at the same time on the same machine the pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself a pet scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do       mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as the abdomen pelvis and brain this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri       bone scan  a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells in the bone a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream the radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner       ultrasound exam a procedure in which highenergy sound waves ultrasound are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram an ultrasound of the major heart vessels is done to stage wilms tumor       cystoscopy  a procedure to look inside the bladder and urethra to check for abnormal areas a cystoscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder a cystoscope is a thin tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing it may also have a tool to remove tissue samples which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body
                    cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood          tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas      lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body      blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood          lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body     blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if wilms tumor spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually wilms tumor cells the disease is metastatic wilms tumor not lung cancer
                
                
                    in addition to the stages wilms tumors are described by their histology
                    the histology how the cells look under a microscope of the tumor affects the prognosis and the treatment of wilms tumor the histology may be favorable or anaplastic unfavorable tumors with a favorable histology have a better prognosis and respond better to chemotherapy than anaplastic tumors tumor cells that are anaplastic divide quickly and under a microscope do not look like the type of cells they came from anaplastic tumors are harder to treat with chemotherapy than other wilms tumors at the same stage
                
                
                    the following stages are used for both favorable histology and anaplastic wilms tumors
                    stage i    in stage i the tumor was completely removed by surgery and all of the following are true              cancer was found only in the kidney and had not spread to blood vessels in the renal sinus the part of the kidney where it joins the ureter or to the lymph nodes       the outer layer of the kidney did not break open      the tumor did not break open      a biopsy was not done before the tumor was removed      no cancer cells were found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed              stage ii    in stage ii the tumor was completely removed by surgery and no cancer cells were found at the edges of the area where the cancer was removed cancer has not spread to lymph nodes before the tumor was removed one of the following was true             cancer had spread to the renal sinus the part of the kidney where it joins the ureter      cancer had spread to blood vessels outside the area of the kidney where urine is made such as the renal sinus              stage iii    in stage iii cancer remains in the abdomen after surgery and one of the following may be true             cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen or pelvis the part of the body between the hips      cancer has spread to or through the surface of the peritoneum the layer of tissue that lines the abdominal cavity and covers most organs in the abdomen      a biopsy of the tumor was done before it was removed      the tumor broke open before or during surgery to remove it      the tumor was removed in more than one piece       cancer cells are found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed      the entire tumor could not be removed because important organs or tissues in the body would be damaged              stage iv    in stage iv cancer has spread through the blood to organs such as the lungs liver bone or brain or to lymph nodes outside of the abdomen and pelvis       stage v    in stage v cancer cells are found in both kidneys when the cancer is first diagnosed
                
                
                    the treatment of other childhood kidney tumors depends on the tumor type"

                    stage i mycosis fungoides     stage i is divided into stage ia and stage ib as follows              stage ia less than  of the skin surface is covered with patches papules andor plaques        stage ib ten percent or more of the skin surface is covered with patches papules andor plaques           there may be abnormal lymphocytes in the blood but they are not cancerous       stage ii mycosis fungoides     stage ii is divided into stage iia and stage iib as follows              stage iia any amount of the skin surface is covered with patches papules andor plaques lymph nodes are enlarged but cancer has not spread to them       stage iib one or more tumors that are  centimeter or larger are found on the skin lymph nodes may be enlarged but cancer has not spread to them           there may be abnormal lymphocytes in the blood but they are not cancerous       stage iii mycosis fungoides    in stage iii nearly all of the skin is reddened and may have patches papules plaques or tumors lymph nodes may be enlarged but cancer has not spread to them    there may be abnormal lymphocytes in the blood but they are not cancerous       stage iv mycosis fungoides     stage iv is divided into stage iva and stage ivb as follows              stage iva most of the skin is reddened and any amount of the skin surface is covered with patches papules plaques or tumors and either                     cancer has spread to lymph nodes and there may be cancerous lymphocytes in the blood or        there are cancerous lymphocytes in the blood and lymph nodes may be enlarged but cancer has not spread to them                   stage ivb most of the skin is reddened and any amount of the skin surface is covered with patches papules plaques or tumors cancer has spread to other organs in the body lymph nodes may be enlarged and cancer may have spread to them there may be cancerous lymphocytes in the blood              stage iv szary syndrome    in stage iv             most of the skin is reddened and covered with patches papules plaques or tumors and      there is a high level of cancerous lymphocytes in the blood and       lymph nodes may be enlarged and cancer may have spread to them"
treatment,what are the treatments for mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome ,"key points
                     there are different types of treatment for patients with mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome cancer      six types of standard treatment are used          photodynamic therapy       radiation therapy       chemotherapy       other drug therapy      biologic therapy      targeted therapy         new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials           highdose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant         treatment for mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome may cause side effects     patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome cancer
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    six types of standard treatment are used
                    photodynamic therapy      photodynamic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells a drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein the drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells for skin cancer laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue patients undergoing photodynamic therapy will need to limit the amount of time spent in sunlight     in one type of photodynamic therapy called psoralen and ultraviolet a puva therapy the patient receives a drug called psoralen and then ultraviolet radiation is directed to the skin in another type of photodynamic therapy called extracorporeal photochemotherapy the patient is given drugs and then some blood cells are taken from the body put under a special ultraviolet a light and put back into the body        radiation therapy      radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy              external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer       internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life sometimes total skin electron beam tseb radiation therapy is used to treat mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome this is a type of external radiation treatment in which a radiation therapy machine aims electrons tiny invisible particles at the skin covering the whole body     ultraviolet b uvb radiation therapy uses a special lamp or laser that directs uvb radiation at the skin        chemotherapy      chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy sometimes the chemotherapy is topical put on the skin in a cream lotion or ointment the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    see drugs approved for nonhodgkin lymphoma for more information mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome are types of nonhodgkin lymphoma       other drug therapy     topical corticosteroids are used to relieve red swollen and inflamed skin they are a type of steroid topical corticosteroids may be in a cream lotion or ointment     retinoids such as bexarotene are drugs related to vitamin a that can slow the growth of certain types of cancer cells the retinoids may be taken by mouth or put on the skin    see drugs approved for nonhodgkin lymphoma for more information mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome are types of nonhodgkin lymphoma       biologic therapy     biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy     interferon is a type of biologic therapy used to treat mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome it interferes with the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth    see drugs approved for nonhodgkin lymphoma for more information mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome are types of nonhodgkin lymphoma       targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells monoclonal antibody therapy and other types of targeted therapies are used to treat mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome     alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion they may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells    other types of monoclonal antibody therapy are being studied in clinical trials to treat mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome      vorinostat and romidepsin are two of the histone deacetylase hdac inhibitors used to treat mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome hdac inhibitors cause a chemical change that stops tumor cells from dividing     pralatrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase dhfr inhibitor used to treat mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome it builds up in cancer cells and stops them from using folate a nutrient needed for cells to divide pralatrexate may slow the growth of tumors and kill cancer cells     see drugs approved for nonhodgkin lymphoma for more information mycosis fungoides and the szary syndrome are types of nonhodgkin lymphoma

capsule that is about the size of a large pill and contains a light and a tiny wireless camera is swallowed by the patient the capsule travels through the digestive tract including the small intestine and sends many pictures of the inside of the digestive tract to a recorder that is worn around the waist or over the shoulder the pictures are sent from the recorder to a computer and viewed by the doctor who checks for signs of cancer the capsule passes out of the body during a bowel movement        double balloon endoscopy  a procedure to look at the inside of the small intestine a special instrument made up of two tubes one inside the other is inserted through the mouth or rectum and into the small intestine the inside tube an endoscope with a light and lens for viewing is moved through part of the small intestine and a balloon at the end of it is inflated to keep the endoscope in place next the outer tube is moved through the small intestine to reach the end of the endoscope and a balloon at the end of the outer tube is inflated to keep it in place then the balloon at the end of the endoscope is deflated and the endoscope is moved through the next part of the small intestine these steps are repeated many times as the tubes move through the small intestine the doctor is able to see the inside of the small intestine through the endoscope and use a tool to remove samples of abnormal tissue the tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer this procedure may be done if the results of a capsule endoscopy are abnormal this procedure is also called double balloon enteroscopy                laparotomy  a surgical procedure in which an incision cut is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease the size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done sometimes organs or lymph nodes are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease       biopsy  the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer this may be done during an endoscopy or laparotomy the sample is checked by a pathologist to see if it contains cancer cells        upper gi series with small bowel followthrough a series of xrays of the esophagus stomach and small bowel the patient drinks a liquid that contains barium a silverwhite metallic compound the liquid coats the esophagus stomach and small bowel xrays are taken at different times as the barium travels through the upper gi tract and small

stages,what are the stages of osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone ,"key points
                     after osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma mfh has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body      there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body     cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body     osteosarcoma and mfh are described as either localized or metastatic
                
                
                    after osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma mfh has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging for osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma mfh most patients are grouped according to whether cancer is found in only one part of the body or has spread    the following tests and procedures may be used            xray  an xray of the organs such as the chest and bones inside the body an xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film making a picture of areas inside the body xrays will be taken of the chest and the area where the tumor formed       ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as the chest taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography pictures will be taken of the chest and the area where the tumor formed       petct scan  a procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography pet scan and a computed tomography ct scan the pet and ct scans are done at the same time on the same machine the pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself a pet scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do       mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri       bone scan  a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells in the bone a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream the radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body
                    cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood          tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas      lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body      blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood          lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body     blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if osteosarcoma spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually osteosarcoma cells the disease is metastatic osteosarcoma not lung cancer
                
                
                    osteosarcoma and mfh are described as either localized or metastatic
                      localized osteosarcoma or mfh has not spread out of the bone where the cancer started there may be one or more areas of cancer in the bone that can be removed during surgery     metastatic osteosarcoma or mfh has spread from the bone in which the cancer began to other parts of the body the cancer most often spreads to the lungs it may also spread to other bones"

susceptibility,who is at risk for childhood astrocytomas ,anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk possible risk factors for astrocytoma include           past radiation therapy to the brain     having certain genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis type   or tuberous sclerosis
exams and tests,how to diagnose childhood astrocytomas ,"tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect find childhood astrocytomas the following tests and procedures may be used            physical exam and history  an exam of the body to check general signs of health this includes checking for signs of disease such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken        neurological exam  a series of questions and tests to check the brain spinal cord and nerve function the exam checks a persons mental status coordination and ability to walk normally and how well the muscles senses and reflexes work this may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam       visual field exam an exam to check a persons field of vision the total area in which objects can be seen this test measures both central vision how much a person can see when looking straight ahead and peripheral vision how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead the eyes are tested one at a time the eye not being tested is covered       mri magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium  a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord a substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein the gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri sometimes magnetic resonance spectroscopy mrs is done during the same mri scan to look at the chemical makeup of the brain tissue
                    childhood astrocytomas are usually diagnosed and removed in surgery if doctors think there may be an astrocytoma a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue for tumors in the brain a part of the skull is removed and a needle is used to remove tissue sometimes the needle is guided by a computer a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells if cancer cells are found the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery because it can be hard to tell the difference between types of brain tumors you may want to have your childs tissue sample checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing brain tumors     the following test may be done on the tissue that was removed            immunohistochemistry  a test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue the antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope this type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer an  test is a type of immunohistochemistry that checks tumor tissue for an antigen called  this may show how fast a tumor is growing        sometimes tumors form in a place that makes them hard to remove if removing the tumor may cause severe physical emotional or learning problems a biopsy is done and more treatment is given after the biopsy   children who have  may form a lowgrade astrocytoma in the area of the brain that controls vision and may not need a biopsy if the tumor does not continue to grow or symptoms do not occur surgery to remove the tumor may not be needed"

susceptibility,who is at risk for diabetic retinopathy ,all people with diabetes  both type  and type   are at risk for diabetic retinopathy people with diabetes are also at increased risk for cataract and glaucoma thats why everyone with diabetes should get a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year between  to  percent of americans diagnosed with diabetes have some stage of diabetic retinopathy if you have diabetic retinopathy your doctor can recommend treatment to help prevent its progression see how to find an eye care professional
causes,what causes prescription and illicit drug abuse ,medications affect older people differently than younger people because aging changes how the body and brain handle these substances as we age our bodies change and cannot break down and get rid of substances as easily as before this means that even a small amount of a medicine or a drug can have a strong effect if you take medications the wrong way or abuse illicit drugs this can have a serious effect on your health and make existing health problems worse as people age they may also become more sensitive to alcohols effects for more information on the dangers of mixing alcohol and medicines see alcohol use and older adults
causes,what causes copd ,smoking most cases of copd develop over time from breathing in fumes and other things that irritate the lungs some of the things that put you at risk for copd include smoking environmental exposure and genetic factors cigarette smoking is the most common cause of copd in the united states either current or former smokers pipe cigar and other types of tobacco smoking can also cause copd especially if the smoke is inhaled environmental exposure copd can also occur in people who have had longterm exposure to things that can irritate your lungs like chemical fumes or dust from the environment or workplace heavy or longterm exposure to secondhand smoke or other air pollutants may also contribute to copd even if you have never smoked or had longterm exposure to harmful pollutants secondhand smoke is smoke in the air from other people smoking genetic factors in a small number of people copd is caused by a genetic condition known as  antitrypsin or aat deficiency people who have this condition have low levels of  antitrypsin aata protein made in the liver having a low level of the aat protein can lead to lung damage and copd if youre exposed to smoke or other lung irritants if you have this condition and smoke copd can worsen very quickly while very few people know if they have aat deficiency it is estimated that about  in every  people to about  in every  people have it people with aat deficiency can get copd even if they have never smoked or had longterm exposure to harmful pollutants asthma although uncommon some people who have asthma can develop copd asthma is a chronic longterm lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways treatment usually can reverse the inflammation and narrowing however if not copd can develop
treatment,what are the treatments for copd ,treatment for copd can be different for each person and is based on whether symptoms are mild moderate or severe treatments include medication pulmonary or lung rehabilitation oxygen treatment and surgery there are also treatments to manage complications or a sudden onset of symptoms
causes,what causes dry mouth ,people get dry mouth when the glands in the mouth that make saliva are not working properly because of this there might not be enough saliva to keep your mouth healthy there are several reasons why these glands called salivary glands might not work right medicines and dry mouth more than  medicines including some overthecounter medications can cause the salivary glands to make less saliva or to change the composition of the saliva so that it cant perform the functions it should as an example medicines for urinary incontinence allergies high blood pressure and depression often cause dry mouth diseases that can cause dry mouth some diseases can affect the salivary glands dry mouth can occur in patients with diabetes dry mouth is also the hallmark symptom of the fairly common autoimmune disease sjgrens syndrome sjgrens syndrome can occur either by itself or with another autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus salivary and tear glands are the major targets of the syndrome and the result is a decrease in production of saliva and tears the disorder can occur at any age but the average person with the disorder at the sjgrens syndrome clinic of the national institute of dental and craniofacial research nidcr is in his or her late  women with the disorder outnumber men  to  cancer treatments and dry mouth certain cancer treatments can affect the salivary glands head and neck radiation therapy can cause the glands to produce little or no saliva chemotherapy may cause the salivary glands to produce thicker saliva which makes the mouth feel dry and sticky injury to the head or neck can damage the nerves that tell salivary glands to make saliva
treatment,what are the treatments for urinary tract infections ,because most utis are caused by bacteria bacteriafighting medications called antibiotics are the usual treatment the type of antibiotic and length of treatment depend on the patients history and the type of bacteria causing the infection bladder infections may eventually get better on their own but antibiotics can make the symptoms go away much more quickly people usually feel better within a day or two of starting antibiotics drinking lots of fluids and urinating often may also speed healing if needed painkillers can relieve the pain of a uti a heating pad on the back or abdomen may also help learn more about treating urinary tract infections
information,what is are high blood pressure ,high blood pressure is a common disease in which blood flows through blood vessels arteries at higher than normal pressures what is blood pressure blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the blood vessels as the heart pumps blood if your blood pressure rises and stays high over time its called high blood pressure high blood pressure is dangerous because it makes the heart work too hard and the high force of the blood flow can harm arteries and organs such as the heart kidneys brain and eyes types of high blood pressure there are two main types of high blood pressure primary and secondary high blood pressure  primary or essential high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure this type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages    secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines this type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed primary or essential high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure this type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines this type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed measuring blood pressure blood pressure is always given as two numbers the systolic and diastolic pressures both are important  systolic pressure  is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart beats    diastolic pressure is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart is at rest between beats systolic pressure  is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart beats  diastolic pressure is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart is at rest between beats usually these numbers are written one above or before the other  for example  mmhg the top or first number is the systolic and the bottom or second number is the diastolic if your blood pressure is  you say that it is  over  normal blood pressure normal blood pressure for adults is defined as a systolic pressure below  mmhg and a diastolic pressure below  mmhg it is normal for blood pressures to change when you sleep wake up or are excited or nervous when you are active it is normal for your blood pressure to increase however once the activity stops your blood pressure returns to your normal baseline range blood pressure normally rises with age and body size newborn babies often have very low blood pressure numbers that are considered normal for babies while older teens have numbers similar to adults abnormal blood pressure abnormal blood pressure is higher than  mmhg if either your systolic or diastolic blood pressure is higher than normal  but not high enough to be considered high blood pressure  you have prehypertension prehypertension is a top number between  and  or a bottom number between  and  mmhg for example blood pressure readings of   or  are all in the prehypertension range click the table on the right to see the stages of high blood pressure in adults a systolic blood pressure of  mmhg or higher or a diastolic blood pressure of  mmhg or higher is considered high blood pressure or hypertension hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure if you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease your recommended blood pressure levels are a systolic blood pressure of  mmhg or lower and a diastolic blood pressure of  mmhg or lower usually has no symptoms high blood pressure is often called the silent killer because it usually has no symptoms occasionally headaches may occur some people may not find out they have high blood pressure until they have trouble with their heart kidneys or eyes when high blood pressure is not diagnosed and treated it can lead to other lifethreatening conditions including heart attack heart failure stroke and kidney failure it can also lead to vision changes or blindness possible complications over time over time high blood pressure can cause  your heart to work too hard and become larger or weaker which can lead to heart failure    small bulges aneurysms to worsen in your blood vessels common locations for aneurysms are the aorta which is the main artery from the heart the arteries in your brain legs and intestines and the artery leading to your spleen   blood vessels in your kidneys to narrow which can cause kidney failure   blood vessels in your eyes to burst or bleed which can cause vision changes and can result in blindness    arteries throughout your body to harden faster especially those in your heart brain kidneys and legs this can cause a heart attack stroke or kidney failure your heart to work too hard and become larger or weaker which can lead to heart failure small bulges aneurysms to worsen in your blood vessels common locations for aneurysms are the aorta which is the main artery

burst or bleed which can cause vision changes and can result in blindness arteries throughout your body to harden faster especially those in your heart brain kidneys and legs this can cause a heart attack stroke or kidney failure
causes,what causes high blood pressure ,changes in body functions researchers continue to study how various changes in normal body functions cause high blood pressure the key functions affected in high blood pressure include   kidney fluid and salt balances    the reninangiotensinaldosterone system    the sympathetic nervous system activity    blood vessel structure and function kidney fluid and salt balances the reninangiotensinaldosterone system the sympathetic nervous system activity blood vessel structure and function kidney fluid and salt balances the kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and eliminating potassium imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes which can cause high blood pressure reninangiotensinaldosterone system the reninangiotensinaldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels which can lead to an increase in blood pressure aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure sympathetic nervous system activity the sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation including heart rate blood pressure and breathing rate researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure blood vessel structure and function changes in the structure and function of small and large arteries may contribute to high blood pressure the angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries which can affect blood pressure genetic causes high blood pressure often runs in families years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure however known genetic factors only account for  to  percent of all cases emerging research suggests that certain dna changes before birth also may cause the development of high blood pressure later in life unhealthy lifestyle habits unhealthy lifestyle habits can cause high blood pressure including  high sodium intake and sodium sensitivity   drinking too much alcohol   lack of physical activity high sodium intake and sodium sensitivity drinking too much alcohol lack of physical activity overweight and obesity research studies show that being overweight or obese can increase the resistance in the blood vessels causing the heart to work harder and leading to high blood pressure medicines prescription medicines such as asthma or hormone therapies including birth control pills and estrogen and overthecounter medicines such as cold relief medicines may cause high blood pressure this happens because medicines can  change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances   cause your blood vessels to constrict    impact the reninangiotensinaldosterone system leading to high blood pressure  change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances cause your blood vessels to constrict impact the reninangiotensinaldosterone system leading to high blood pressure other causes other causes of high blood pressure include medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease sleep apnea thyroid problems or certain tumors these conditions can change the way your body controls fluids sodium and hormones in your blood which leads to secondary high blood pressure
prevention,how to prevent heart failure ,ways to prevent heart failure include  keeping your cholesterol and blood pressure levels healthy   keeping diabetes in check    maintaining a healthy weight    quitting smoking    following a heart healthy diet   limiting the amount of alcohol you drink    eating a diet low in salt because salt can cause extra fluid to build up in your body and also contribute to high blood pressure older adults should limit their sodium salt intake  mg a day about  tsp of salt    getting regular exercise aim for at least  minutes a day of exercise check with your doctor before starting any exercise program for information about exercises that older adults can do safely see exercises to try or visit  the exercise and physical activity campaign for older adults from the national institute on aging  keeping your cholesterol and blood pressure levels healthy keeping diabetes in check maintaining a healthy weight quitting smoking following a heart healthy diet limiting the amount of alcohol you drink eating a diet low in salt because salt can cause extra fluid to build up in your body and also contribute to high blood pressure older adults should limit their sodium salt intake  mg a day about  tsp of salt getting regular exercise aim for at least  minutes a day of exercise check with your doctor before starting any exercise program for information about exercises that older adults can do safely see exercises to try or visit  the exercise and physical activity campaign for older adults from the national institute on aging
treatment,what are the treatments for problems with taste ,relief is possible although there is no treatment for any gradual loss of taste that occurs with aging relief from taste disorders is possible for many older people depending on the cause of your problem with taste your doctor may be able to treat it or suggest ways to cope with it scientists are studying how loss of taste occurs so that treatments can be developed some patients regain their sense of taste when the condition or illness that is causing the loss of taste is over for example a middle ear infection often affects taste temporarily often correcting the general medical problem can restore the sense of taste check your medications often a certain medication is the cause of a taste disorder and stopping or changing the medicine may help eliminate the problem if you take medications ask your doctor if they can affect your sense of taste if so ask if you can take other medications or safely reduce the dose do not stop taking your medications unless directed by your doctor your doctor will work with you to get the medicines you need while trying to reduce unwanted side effects if your diet is affected because your sense of taste may gradually decline you may not even notice the change but your diet may change and not for the better you may lose interest in food and eat less but you may choose foods that are high in fat and sugars or you may eat more than you should hoping to get more flavor from every bite if you lose some or all of your sense of taste there are things you can do to make your food taste better  prepare foods with a variety of colors and textures   use aromatic herbs and hot spices to add more flavor however avoid adding more sugar or salt to food    if your diet permits use small amounts of cheese bacon bits or butter on vegetables as well as olive oil or toasted nuts   avoid combination dishes such as casseroles that can hide individual flavors and dilute taste prepare foods with a variety of colors and textures use aromatic herbs and hot spices to add more flavor however avoid adding more sugar or salt to food if your diet permits use small amounts of cheese bacon bits or butter on vegetables as well as olive oil or toasted nuts avoid combination dishes such as casseroles that can hide individual flavors and dilute taste if your sense of taste does not return if you cannot regain your sense of taste there are things you can do to ensure your safety take extra care to avoid food that may have spoiled if you live with other people ask them to smell and taste food to make sure it is fresh people who live alone should discard food if there is a chance it is spoiled for those who wish to have additional help there may be support groups in your area these are often associated with smell and taste clinics in medical school hospitals some online bulletin boards also allow people with smell and taste disorders to share their experiences not all people with taste disorders will regain their sense of taste but most can learn to live with it
prevention,how to prevent problems with taste ,problems with taste that occur with aging cannot be prevented however you may be able to protect yourself against other causes of taste loss with these steps  prevent upper respiratory infections such as colds and the flu wash your hands frequently especially during the winter months and get a flu shot every year    avoid head injuries always wear seatbelts when riding in a car and a helmet when bicycling    avoid exposure to toxic chemicals avoid contact with chemicals that might cause smell problems such as paints insecticides and solvents or wear a respirator if you cannot avoid contact    review your medications if you are taking antibiotics or antihistamines or other medications and notice a change in your sense of taste talk to your doctor you may be able to adjust or change your medicine to one that will not cause a problem with taste do not stop taking your medications unless directed by your doctor    dont smoke it can impair the sense of taste for free help to quit smoking visit smokefreegov  prevent upper respiratory infections such as colds and the flu wash your hands frequently especially during the winter months and get a flu shot every year avoid head injuries always wear seatbelts when riding in a car and a helmet when bicycling avoid exposure to toxic chemicals avoid contact with chemicals that might cause smell problems such as paints insecticides and solvents or wear a respirator if you cannot avoid contact review your medications if you are taking antibiotics or antihistamines or other medications and notice a change in your sense of taste talk to your doctor you may be able to adjust or change your medicine to one that will not cause a problem with taste do not stop taking your medications unless directed by your doctor dont smoke it can impair the sense of taste for free help to quit smoking visit smokefreegov
exams and tests,how to diagnose problems with taste ,doctors can diagnose a taste disorder by measuring the lowest concentration of a substance that a person can detect the doctor may also ask a patient to compare the tastes of different substances or to note how the intensity of a taste grows when a substances concentration is increased scientists have developed taste tests in which a person responds to different concentrations of a substance this may involve a simple sip spit and rinse test or the application of a substance directly to the tongue with an eye dropper by using these tests your doctor can determine if you have a true taste disorder and what type it is
research,what research or clinical trials is being done for depression ,treating older adults studies show that the majority of older adults with depression improve when they receive treatment with an antidepressant psychotherapy or a combination of both in addition research has indicated that treating depression in older adults often improves the outcomes of coexisting medical conditions some research has also suggested that the risk for developing depression in people who have had a stroke may be reduced if they receive preventative treatment with an antidepressant or talk therapy special considerations however there are some special considerations that doctors must take into account when treating older adults the commonly prescribed medications for depression may not work well for some older adults because they may interact unfavorably with other medications being taken for other conditions some older adults with depression may also have some problems thinking clearly and these individuals often respond poorly to the drugs which form of treatment is most effective many older adults prefer to get counseling or psychotherapy for depression rather than add more medications to those they are already taking for other conditions research suggests that for older adults psychotherapy is just as likely to be an effective first treatment for depression as taking an antidepressant there is a great deal of evidence indicating that cognitivebehavioral therapy cbt including a version called problem solving therapy may be an especially useful type of psychotherapy for treating older adults and improving their quality of life however a practical issue to consider when deciding on treatment is that it may be harder for many older people to find or be able to travel to meetings with a welltrained psychotherapist than to get a prescription for antidepressant medication from their primary care doctor also some research suggests that treatment with medication may be more effective if the depression is quite severe or if the older adult is coping with other serious illnesses overall research has suggested that when possible a combination of medication and psychotherapy treatment is likely to be most effective in treating depression in older adults and in particular for reducing the number of new episodes latelife depression is often undiagnosed despite progress in treatment research latelife depression often goes undiagnosed or is inadequately treated in older adults in fact several studies have found that up to  percent of older adults who die by suicide had visited their primary care doctors within one month of their deaths collaborative or comprehensive care may lead to better treatment results collaborative care the prevention of suicide in primary care elderly collaborative trial prospect offered antidepressant medication andor psychotherapy to depressed older adults along with a care manager  a social worker nurse or psychologist  who monitored their symptoms side effects of medication and progress the study found that those participants who had casemanaged care got better more quickly had longer periods without depression and in general responded better to treatment than those who did not have casemanaged care another study called the improving mood promoting access to collaborative treatment impact trial also found that collaborative care was more effective than usual care and was less expensive over the long run as well improving diagnosis of depression several studies are looking at ways to help older adults get better access to depression treatment one is developing and testing an education and intervention program to help primary care clinics and providers identify and treat latelife depression another study found that depressed older adults who had a care manager monitor their symptoms side effects and progress got better more quickly  and stayed better longer  than those who did not have casemanaged care still other projects are investigating ways of improving older adults engagement in and ability to follow treatment plans for depression researchers are also looking at ways to   better understand the relationship between other medical illnesses and depression    integrate treatment for depression with treatments for other medical conditions a person may have   produce a quicker response to treatment    develop new methods for delivering treatment to those who are homebound unable to move around without assistance or who live in rural areas eg via use of telephonic or

prevention,how to prevent diabetes ,the two most common forms of diabetes are type  and type  currently there is no way to delay or prevent type  diabetes however research has shown that type  diabetes can be prevented or delayed in people at risk for the disease preventing type  diabetes can mean a healthier and longer life without serious complications from the disease such as heart disease stroke blindness kidney failure and amputations preventing type  diabetes before people develop type  diabetes they usually have prediabetes  a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not yet high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes the good news is that if you have prediabetes there are ways to reduce your risk of getting type  diabetes with modest weight loss and moderate physical activity you can delay or prevent type  diabetes benefits of weight loss and exercise  the diabetes prevention program dpp is a landmark study by the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases dpp researchers found that adults at high risk for type  diabetes were able to cut their risk in half by losing a modest amount of weight and being active almost every day this means losing  to  percent of body weight thats  pounds if you weigh  pounds and getting  minutes of physical activity a week the drug metformin reduced the risk of type  diabetes

number closest to the persons weight find the number at the top of that column the number at the top of the column is the persons bmi the words above the bmi number indicate whether the person is normal weight overweight or obese people who are overweight or obese should consider talking with a health care provider about ways to lose weight and reduce the risk of diabetes the bmi has certain limitations the bmi may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build and underestimate body fat in older adults and others who have lost muscle  waist measurement in addition to weight the location of excess fat on the body can be important a waist measurement of  inches or more for men and  inches or more for women is linked to insulin resistance and increases a persons risk for type  diabetes this is true even if a persons body mass index bmi falls within the normal range to measure the waist a person should  place a tape measure around the bare abdomen just above the hip bone   make sure the tape is snug but isnt digging into the skin and is parallel to the floor   relax exhale and measure place a tape measure around the bare abdomen just above the hip bone

causes,what causes alzheimers disease ,there are two types of alzheimers diseaseearlyonset and lateonset earlyonset alzheimers is a rare form of the disease that occurs in people age  to  it occurs in less than  percent of all people with alzheimers almost all people with alzheimers disease have lateonset alzheimers which usually develops after age  causes not fully understood scientists do not yet fully understand what causes alzheimers disease in most people in earlyonset alzheimers a genetic mutation is usually the cause lateonset alzheimers arises from a complex series of brain changes that occur over decades the causes probably include a mix of genetic environmental and lifestyle factors these factors affect each person differently research shows that alzheimers disease causes changes in the brain years and even decades before the first symptoms appear so even people who seem free of the disease today may be at risk scientists are developing sophisticated tests to help identify who is most likely to develop symptoms of alzheimers ultimately they hope to prevent or delay dementia in these highrisk individuals risk factors some risk factors for alzheimers like age and genetics cannot be controlled other factors that may play a role in the development of the diseasesuch as how much a person exercises or socializescan be changed lifestyle factors such as diet and physical exercise and longterm health conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes might also play a role in the risk of developing alzheimers disease for more information see the chapter entitled prevention older agethe biggest risk factor increasing age is the most important known risk factor for alzheimers disease the number of people with the disease doubles every  years beyond age  nearly half of people age  and older may have alzheimers these facts are significant because the number of older adults is growing genetics genetics appears to play a part in both early and lateonset alzheimers disease in earlyonset alzheimers most cases are caused by specific genetic mutations permanent changes in genes that can be passed on from a parent to a child this results in earlyonset familial alzheimers disease or fad most people with alzheimers disease have lateonset alzheimers in which symptoms appear in a persons  no obvious family pattern is seen in most of these cases but certain genetic factors appear to increase a persons risk many studies have linked the apolipoprotein e gene to lateonset alzheimers one form of this gene apoe  increases a persons risk of getting the disease but many people who get alzheimers do not have the apoe  gene and some people with the gene never get alzheimers scientists have identified a number of other genes in addition to apoe  that may increase a persons risk for lateonset alzheimers knowing about these genes can help researchers more effectively test possible treatments and prevention strategies in people who are at risk of developing alzheimers  ideally before symptoms appear learn more about the genetics of alzheimers disease
exams and tests,how to diagnose alzheimers disease ,the only definitive way to diagnose alzheimers disease is to find out whether plaques and tangles exist in brain tissue to look at brain tissue doctors perform a brain autopsy an examination of the brain done after a person dies doctors can only make a diagnosis of possible or probable alzheimers disease while a person is alive doctors with special training can diagnose alzheimers disease correctly up to  percent of the time doctors who can diagnose alzheimers include geriatricians geriatric psychiatrists and neurologists a geriatrician specializes in the treatment of older adults a geriatric psychiatrist specializes in mental problems in older adults a neurologist specializes in brain and nervous system disorders to diagnose alzheimers disease doctors may  ask questions about overall health past medical problems ability to carry out daily activities and changes in behavior and personality   conduct tests to measure memory problem solving attention counting and language skills    carry out standard medical tests such as blood and urine tests   perform brain scans to look for anything in the brain that does not look normal ask questions about overall health past medical problems ability to carry out daily activities and changes in behavior and personality conduct tests to measure memory problem solving attention counting and language skills carry out standard medical tests such as blood and urine tests perform brain scans to look for anything in the brain that does not look normal
research,what research or clinical trials is being done for psoriasis ,scientists who are working to better understand and treat psoriasis are making headway in several different areas the role of t cells scientists believe that psoriasis occurs when white blood cells called t cells which normally help fight infections attack the bodys skin cells by mistake scientists are working to understand what causes these cells to go awry in people with psoriasis their hope is that by better understanding why t cells attack the bodys healthy skin tissue they can develop better treatments to stop or prevent that damaging process new treatments since discovering that t cells attack skin cells in psoriasis researchers have been studying new treatments that quiet immune system reactions in the skin among these are treatments that block the activity of t cells or block cytokines proteins that promote inflammation if researchers find a way to target only the diseasecausing immune reactions while leaving the rest of the immune system alone resulting treatments could benefit psoriasis patients as well as those with other autoimmune diseases when the immune system attacks the bodys own tissues currently there are a number of potential psoriasis treatments in clinical trials including injections pills and topical ointments clinical trials are research studies with volunteers in which drugs are tested for the effectiveness and safety all drugs must complete and pass this process before they can be approved by the fda psoriasis genes because psoriasis is more common among people who have one or more family members with the disease scientists have long suspected that genes are involved a number of genetic loci  specific locations on the genes  have been associated with the development of psoriasis or the severity or progression of the disease in  scientists discovered the first gene to be directly linked to development of plaque psoriasis researchers continue to study the genetic aspects of psoriasis and some studies are looking at the nervous system to determine the genes responsible for the circuitry that causes itching psoriasisrelated conditions research in recent years has shown that people with psoriasis are more likely to develop other health problems including problems with the heart and blood vessels research is continuing to examine links between psoriasis and other health problems scientists are working to understand how and why these diseases occur in people with psoriasis with the hope that this understanding will lead to better treatments for both psoriasis and the related diseases stress reduction treatment for many people with psoriasis life stresses cause the disease to worsen or become more active research suggests that stress is associated with the increased production of chemicals by the immune system that promote inflammation the same chemicals may play a role in the anxiety and depression that is common in people with psoriasis researchers are studying the use of stress reduction techniques along with medical treatment in the hope that reducing stress will both lower anxiety and improve the skin lesions of psoriasis where to

exams and tests,how to diagnose leukemia ,there are no standard or overthecounter tests for leukemia your doctor can request lab analyses for leukemia that include blood tests that check the levels and types of blood cells and look for changes in the shape of blood cells the doctor may also look for signs of leukemia in the bone marrow or the fluid around the brain or the spinal cord
exams and tests,how to diagnose parkinsons disease ,there are currently no blood or laboratory tests to diagnose sporadic parkinsons disease diagnosis is based on a persons medical history and a neurological examination but the disease can be difficult to diagnose accurately doctors may sometimes request brain scans or laboratory tests in order to rule out other diseases however computed tomography ct and magnetic resonance imaging mri brain scans of people with parkinsons usually appear normal recently the fda food and drug administration has approved an imaging technique called datscan which may help to increase accuracy of the diagnosis of parkinsons disease since many other diseases have similar features but require different treatments it is very important to make an exact diagnosis as soon as possible to ensure proper treatment
information,what is are problems with smell ,our sense of smell helps us enjoy life we delight in the aromas of our favorite foods or the fragrance of flowers our sense of smell also is a warning system alerting us to danger signals such as a gas leak spoiled food or a fire any loss in our sense of smell can have a negative effect on our quality of life it also can be a sign of more serious health problems aging and smell loss problems with smell increase as people get older and they are more common in men than women in one study nearly onequarter of men ages  had a smell disorder while about  percent of women in that age range reported a problem many older people are not even aware that they have a problem with their sense of smell because the changes occur gradually over several years they may not even notice that they are experiencing a loss of smell until there is an incident in which they dont detect food that has spoiled or the presence of dangerous smoke how our sense of smell works the sense of smell or olfaction is part of our chemical sensing system along with the sense of taste normal smell occurs when odors around us like the fragrance of flowers or the smell of baking bread stimulate the specialized sensory cells called olfactory sensory cells olfactory sensory cells are located in a small patch of tissue high inside the nose odors reach the olfactory sensory cells in two pathways the first pathway is by inhaling or sniffing through your nose when people think about smell they generally think of this pathway the second pathway is less familiar it is a channel that connects the roof of the throat region to the nose when we chew our food aromas are released that access olfactory sensory cells through this channel if you are congested due to a head cold or sinus infection this channel is blocked which temporarily affects your ability to appreciate the flavors of food types of smell disorders people who experience smell disorders either have a decrease in their ability to smell or changes in the way they perceive odors total smell loss is relatively rare but a decrease in the sense of smell occurs more often especially in older adults a decreased sense of smell may be temporary and treatable with medication there are several types of smell disorders depending on how the sense of smell is affected   some people have hyposmia which occurs when their ability to detect certain odors is reduced    other people cant detect odor at all which is called anosmia    sometimes a loss of smell can be accompanied by a change in the perception of odors this type of smell disorder is called dysosmia familiar odors may become distorted or an odor that usually smells pleasant instead smells foul    still others may perceive a smell that isnt present at all which is called phantosmia    smell loss due to aging is called presbyosmia  some people have hyposmia which occurs when their ability to detect certain odors is reduced other people cant detect odor at all which is called anosmia  sometimes a loss of smell can be accompanied by a change in the perception of odors this type of smell disorder is called dysosmia familiar odors may become distorted or an odor that usually smells pleasant instead smells foul still others may perceive a smell that isnt present at all which is called phantosmia  smell loss due to aging is called presbyosmia smell loss may signal other conditions problems with our chemical senses may be a sign of other serious health conditions a smell disorder can be an early sign of parkinsons disease alzheimers disease or multiple sclerosis it can also be related to other medical conditions such as obesity diabetes hypertension and malnutrition getting a diagnosis early will help an individual deal better with the underlying condition or disease smell and taste smell and taste are closely linked in the brain but are actually distinct sensory systems true tastes are detected by taste buds on the tongue and the roof of the mouth as well as in the throat region and are limited to sweet salty sour bitter savory and perhaps a few other sensations the loss of smell is much more common than the loss of taste and many people mistakenly believe they have a problem with taste when they are really experiencing a problem with their sense of smell a loss in taste or smell is diagnosed by your doctor using special taste and smell tests smell loss and eating habits when smell is impaired people usually have problems appreciating the subtle flavors of food and say that food is less enjoyable some people change their eating habits some may eat too little and lose weight while others may eat too much and gain weight either way there may be a longterm impact on ones overall health loss of smell may also cause us to eat too much sugar or salt to make our food taste better this can be a problem for people with certain medical conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure in severe cases loss of smell can lead to depression hazards of smell loss research shows that people with a total or partial loss of smell are almost twice as likely as people with normal smell to have certain kinds of accidents the most common types of accidents in order of frequency involve  cooking    eating or drinking spoiled foods or toxic substances    failing to detect gas leaks or fires  cooking eating or drinking spoiled foods or toxic substances failing to detect gas leaks or fires if you think you have a problem with your sense of smell see your doctor

specialists involved
                
your primary care doctor usually can diagnose and treat rls however he or she also may suggest that you see a sleep specialist or neurologist
                
signs and symptoms
                
you must have the four key signs of rls to be diagnosed with the disorder
                
your doctor will want to know how your symptoms are affecting your sleep and how alert you are during the day
                
to help your doctor you may want to keep a sleep diary use the diary to keep a daily record of how easy it is to fall and stay asleep how much sleep you get at night and how alert you feel during the day
                
for a sample sleep diary go to the national heart lung and blood institutes your guide to healthy sleep
                
medical and family histories
                
your doctor may ask whether you have any of the diseases or conditions that can trigger rls these include kidney failure parkinsons disease diabetes rheumatoid arthritis pregnancy and iron deficiency
                
your doctor also may want to know what medicines you take some medicines can trigger or worsen rls
                
the most common type of rls tends to run in families thus your doctor may ask whether any of your relatives have rls
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will do a physical exam to check for underlying conditions that may trigger rls he or she also will check for other conditions that have symptoms similar to those of rls
                
diagnostic tests
                
currently no test can diagnose rls still your doctor may recommend blood tests to measure your iron levels he or she also may suggest muscle or nerve tests these tests can show whether you have a condition that can worsen rls or that has symptoms similar to those of rls
                
rarely sleep studies are used to help diagnose rls a sleep study measures how much and how well you sleep although rls can cause a lack of sleep this sign isnt specific enough to diagnose the condition
                
researchers continue to study new ways to diagnose rls
                
drug therapy trial
                
if your doctor thinks you have rls he or she may prescribe certain medicines to relieve your symptoms these medicines which are used to treat people who have parkinsons disease also can relieve rls symptoms if the medicines relieve your symptoms your doctor can confirm that you have rls"
information,what is are respiratory distress syndrome ,"respiratory distress syndrome rds is a breathing disorder that affects newborns rds rarely occurs in fullterm infants the disorder is more common in premature infants born about  weeks or more before their due dates
                
rds is more common in premature infants because their lungs arent able to make enough surfactant surfaktant surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs it helps keep them open so that infants can breathe in air once theyre born
                
without enough surfactant the lungs collapse and the infant has to work hard to breathe he or she might not be able to breathe in enough oxygen to support the bodys organs the lack of oxygen can damage the babys brain and other organs if proper treatment isnt given
                
most babies who develop rds show signs of breathing problems and a lack of oxygen at birth or within the first few hours that follow
                
overview
                
rds is a common lung disorder in premature infants in fact nearly all infants born before  weeks of pregnancy develop rds
                
rds might be an early phase of bronchopulmonary dysplasia brongkopulmonare displazeah or bpd this is another breathing disorder that affects premature babies
                
rds usually develops in the first  hours after birth if premature infants still have breathing problems by the time they reach their original due dates they may be diagnosed with bpd some of the lifesaving treatments used for rds may cause bpd
                
some infants who have rds recover and never get bpd infants who do get bpd have lungs that are less developed or more damaged than the infants who recover
                
infants who develop bpd usually have fewer healthy air sacs and tiny blood vessels in their lungs both the air sacs and the tiny blood vessels that support them are needed to breathe well
                
outlook
                
due to improved treatments and medical advances most infants who have rds survive however these babies may need extra medical care after going home
                
some babies have complications from rds or its treatments serious complications include chronic ongoing breathing problems such as asthma and bpd blindness and brain damage"
causes,what causes respiratory distress syndrome ,"the main cause of respiratory distress syndrome rds is a lack of surfactant in the lungs surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs
                
a fetuss lungs start making surfactant during the third trimester of pregnancy weeks  through labor and delivery the substance coats the insides of the air sacs in the lungs this helps keep the lungs open so breathing can occur after birth
                
without enough surfactant the lungs will likely collapse when the infant exhales breathes out the infant then has to work harder to breathe he or she might not be able to get enough oxygen to support the bodys organs
                
some fullterm infants develop rds because they have faulty genes that affect how their bodies make surfactant"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of respiratory distress syndrome ,"signs and symptoms of respiratory distress syndrome rds usually occur at birth or within the first few hours that follow they include
                
rapid shallow breathing
                
sharp pulling in of the chest below and between the ribs with each breath
                
grunting sounds
                
flaring of the nostrils
                
the infant also may have pauses in breathing that last for a few seconds this condition is called apnea apneah
                
respiratory distress syndrome complications
                
depending on the severity of an infants rds he or she may develop other medical problems
                
lung complications
                
lung complications may include a collapsed lung atelectasis leakage of air from the lung into the chest cavity pneumothorax and bleeding in the lung hemorrhage
                
some of the lifesaving treatments used for rds may cause bronchopulmonary dysplasia another breathing disorder
                
blood and blood vessel complications
                
infants who have rds may develop sepsis an infection of the bloodstream this infection can be life threatening
                
lack of oxygen may prevent a fetal blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus from closing after birth as it should this condition is called patent ductus arteriosus or pda
                
the ductus arteriosus connects a lung artery to a heart artery if it remains open it can strain the heart and increase blood pressure in the lung arteries
                
other complications
                
complications of rds also may include blindness and other eye problems and a bowel disease called necrotizing enterocolitis enterokolitis infants who have severe rds can develop kidney failure
                
some infants who have rds develop bleeding in the brain this bleeding can delay mental development it also can cause mental retardation or cerebral palsy"
information,what is are tetralogy of fallot ,"tetralogy tehtraloje of fallot fahlo is a congenital heart defect this is a problem with the hearts structure thats present at birth congenital heart defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart
                
tetralogy of fallot is a rare complex heart defect it occurs in about  of every  babies the defect affects boys and girls equally
                
to understand tetralogy of fallot it helps to know how a healthy heart works the health topics how the heart works article describes the structure and function of a healthy heart the article also has animations that show how your heart pumps blood and how your hearts electrical system works
                
overview
                
tetralogy of fallot involves four heart defects
                
a large ventricular septal defect vsd
                
pulmonary pullmunary stenosis
                
right ventricular hypertrophy hipertrofe
                
an overriding aorta
                
ventricular septal defect
                
the heart has an inner wall that separates the two chambers on its left side from the two chambers on its right side this wall is called a septum the septum prevents blood from mixing between the two sides of the heart
                
a vsd is a hole in the septum between the hearts two lower chambers the ventricles the hole allows oxygenrich blood from the left ventricle to mix with oxygenpoor blood from the right ventricle
                
pulmonary stenosis
                
this defect involves narrowing of the pulmonary valve and the passage from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery
                
normally oxygenpoor blood from the right ventricle flows through the pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery from there the blood travels to the lungs to pick up oxygen
                
in pulmonary stenosis the pulmonary valve cannot fully open thus the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the valve as a result not enough blood reaches the lungs
                
right ventricular hypertrophy
                
with this defect the muscle of the right ventricle is thicker than usual this occurs because the heart has to work harder than normal to move blood through the narrowed pulmonary valve
                
overriding aorta
                
this defect occurs in the aorta the main artery that carries oxygenrich blood from the heart to the body in a healthy heart the aorta is attached to the left ventricle this allows only oxygenrich blood to flow to the body
                
in tetralogy of fallot the aorta is located between the left and right ventricles directly over the vsd as a result oxygenpoor blood from the right ventricle flows directly into the aorta instead of into the pulmonary artery
                
outlook
                
with tetralogy of fallot not enough blood is able to reach the lungs to get oxygen and oxygenpoor blood flows to the body
                
crosssection of a normal heart and a heart with tetralogy of fallot
                

                
babies and children who have tetralogy of fallot have episodes of cyanosis siahnosis cyanosis is a bluish tint to the skin lips and fingernails it occurs because the oxygen level in the blood leaving the heart is below normal
                
tetralogy of fallot is repaired with openheart surgery either soon after birth or later in infancy the timing of the surgery will depend on how narrow the pulmonary artery is
                
over the past few decades the diagnosis and treatment of tetralogy of fallot have greatly improved most children who have this heart defect survive to adulthood however theyll need lifelong medical care from specialists to help them stay as healthy as possible"
treatment,what are the treatments for sudden cardiac arrest ,"emergency treatment
                
sudden cardiac arrest sca is an emergency a person having sca needs to be treated with a defibrillator right away this device sends an electric shock to the heart the electric shock can restore a normal rhythm to a heart thats stopped beating
                
to work well defibrillation must be done within minutes of sca with every minute that passes the chances of surviving sca drop rapidly
                
police emergency medical technicians and other first responders usually are trained and equipped to use a defibrillator call  right away if someone has signs or symptoms of sca the sooner you call for help the sooner lifesaving treatment can begin
                
automated external defibrillators
                
automated external defibrillators aeds are special defibrillators that untrained bystanders can use these portable devices often are found in public places such as shopping malls golf courses businesses airports airplanes casinos convention centers hotels sports venues and schools
                
aeds are programmed to give an electric shock if they detect a dangerous arrhythmia such as ventricular fibrillation this prevents giving a shock to someone who may have fainted but isnt having sca
                
you should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr to a person having sca until defibrillation can be done
                
people who are at risk for sca may want to consider having an aed at home a  study by the national heart lung and blood institute and the national institutes of health found that aeds in the home are safe and effective
                
some people feel that placing these devices in homes will save many lives because many scas occur at homeothers note that no evidence supports the idea that homeuse aeds save more lives these people fear that people who have aeds in their homes will delay calling for help during an emergency theyre also concerned that people who have homeuse aeds will not properly maintain the devices or forget where they are
                
when considering a homeuse aed talk with your doctor he or she can help you decide whether having an aed in your home will benefit you
                
treatment in a hospital
                
if you survive sca youll likely be admitted to a hospital for ongoing care and treatment in the hospital your medical team will closely watch your heart they may give you medicines to try to reduce the risk of another sca
                
while in the hospital your medical team will try to find out what caused your sca if youre diagnosed with coronary heart disease you may havepercutaneous coronary intervention also known as coronary angioplastyor coronary artery bypass grafting these procedures help restore blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries
                
often people who have sca get a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd this small device is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen an icd uses electric pulses or shocks to help control dangerous arrhythmias for more information go to how can death due to sudden cardiac arrest be prevented"
exams and tests,how to diagnose holes in the heart ,"doctors usually diagnose holes in the heart based on a physical exam and the results from tests and procedures the exam findings for an atrial septal defect asd often arent obvious thus the diagnosis sometimes isnt made until later in childhood or even in adulthood
                
ventricular septal defects vsds cause a very distinct heart murmur because of this a diagnosis usually is made in infancy
                
specialists involved
                
doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating heart problems are called cardiologists pediatric cardiologists take care of babies and children who have heart problems cardiac surgeons repair heart defects using surgery
                
physical exam
                
during a physical exam your childs doctor will listen to your childs heart and lungs with a stethoscope the doctor also will look for signs of a heart defect such as a heart murmur or signs of heart failure
                
diagnostic tests and procedures
                
your childs doctor may recommend several tests to diagnose an asd or vsd these tests also will help the doctor figure out the location and size of the defect
                
echocardiography
                
echocardiography echo is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart the sound waves called ultrasound bounce off the structures of the heart a computer converts the sound waves into pictures on a screen
                
echo allows the doctor to clearly see any problem with the way the heart is formed or the way its working
                
echo is an important test for both diagnosing a hole in the heart and following the problem over time echo can show problems with the hearts structure and how the heart is reacting to the problems this test will help your childs cardiologist decide whether and when treatment is needed
                
ekg electrocardiogram
                
an ekg is a simple painless test that records the hearts electrical activity the test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm steady or irregular it also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart
                
an ekg can detect whether one of the hearts chambers is enlarged which can help diagnose a heart problem
                
chest x ray
                
a chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in the chest such as the heart lungs and blood vessels
                
this test can show whether the heart is enlarged a chest x ray also can show whether the lungs have extra blood flow or extra fluid a sign of heart failure
                
pulse oximetry
                
pulse oximetry shows the level of oxygen in the blood a small sensor is attached to a finger or ear the sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in the blood
                
cardiac catheterization
                
during cardiac catheterization katheterizashun a thin flexible tube called a catheter is put into a vein in the arm groin upper thigh or neck the tube is threaded to the heart
                
special dye is injected through the catheter into a blood vessel or one of the hearts chambers the dye allows the doctor to see the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels on an xray image
                
the doctor also can use cardiac catheterization to measure the pressure inside the heart chambers and blood vessels this can help the doctor figure out whether blood is mixing between the two sides of the heart
                
doctors also use cardiac catheterization to repair some heart defects for more information go to how are holes in the heart treated"
information,what is are congenital heart defects ,"congenital konjenihtal heart defects are problems with the hearts structure that are present at birth these defects can involve
                
the interior walls of the heart
                
the valves inside the heart
                
the arteries and veins that carry blood to the heart or the body
                
congenital heart defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart
                
there are many types of congenital heart defects they range from simple defects with no symptoms to complex defects with severe lifethreatening symptoms
                
congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect they affect  out of every  newborns each year more than  babies in the united states are born with congenital heart defects
                
many of these defects are simple conditions they need no treatment or are easily fixed some babies are born with complex congenital heart defects these defects require special medical care soon after birth
                
the diagnosis and treatment of complex heart defects has greatly improved over the past few decades as a result almost all children who have complex heart defects survive to adulthood and can live active productive lives
                
most people who have complex heart defects continue to need special heart care throughout their lives they may need to pay special attention to how their condition affects issues such as health insurance employment birth control and pregnancy and other health issues
                
in the united states more than  million adults are living with congenital heart defects"
information,what is are bronchitis ,"espaol
                
bronchitis bronkitis is a condition in which the bronchial tubes become inflamed these tubes carry air to your lungs for more information about the bronchial tubes and airways go to the diseases and conditions index how the lungs work article
                
people who have bronchitis often have a cough that brings up mucus mucus is a slimy substance made by the lining of the bronchial tubes bronchitis also may cause wheezing a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe chest pain or discomfort a low fever and shortness of breath
                
bronchitis
                

                
overview
                
the two main types of bronchitis are acute short term and chronic ongoing
                
acute bronchitis
                
infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis the same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis these viruses are spread through the air when people cough they also are spread through physical contact for example on hands that have not been washed
                
sometimes bacteria cause acute bronchitis
                
acute bronchitis lasts from a few days to  days however coughing may last for several weeks after the infection is gone
                
several factors increase your risk for acute bronchitis examples include exposure to tobacco smoke including secondhand smoke dust fumes vapors and air pollution avoiding these lung irritants as much as possible can help lower your risk for acute bronchitis
                
most cases of acute bronchitis go away within a few days if you think you have acute bronchitis see your doctor he or she will want to rule out other more serious health conditions that require medical care
                
chronic bronchitis
                
chronic bronchitis is an ongoing serious condition it occurs if the lining of the bronchial tubes is constantly irritated and inflamed causing a longterm cough with mucus smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis
                
viruses or bacteria can easily infect the irritated bronchial tubes if this happens the condition worsens and lasts longer as a result people who have chronic bronchitis have periods when symptoms get much worse than usual
                
chronic bronchitis is a serious longterm medical condition early diagnosis and treatment combined with quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke can improve quality of life the chance of complete recovery is low for people who have severe chronic bronchitis"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of bronchitis ,"acute bronchitis
                
acute bronchitis caused by an infection usually develops after you already have a cold or the flu symptoms of a cold or the flu include sore throat fatigue tiredness fever body aches stuffy or runny nose vomiting and diarrhea
                
the main symptom of acute bronchitis is a persistent cough which may last  to  days the cough may produce clear mucus a slimy substance if the mucus is yellow or green you may have a bacterial infection as well even after the infection clears up you may still have a dry cough for days or weeks
                
other symptoms of acute bronchitis include wheezing a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe low fever and chest tightness or pain
                
if your acute bronchitis is severe you also may have shortness of breath especially with physical activity
                
chronic bronchitis
                
the signs and symptoms of chronic bronchitis include coughing wheezing and chest discomfort the coughing may produce large amounts of mucus this type of cough often is called a smokers cough"
treatment,what are the treatments for bronchitis ,"the main goals of treating acute and chronic bronchitis are to relieve symptoms and make breathing easier
                
if you have acute bronchitis your doctor may recommend rest plenty of fluids and aspirin for adults or acetaminophen to treat fever
                
antibiotics usually arent prescribed for acute bronchitis this is because they dont work against virusesthe most common cause of acute bronchitis however if your doctor thinks you have a bacterial infection he or she may prescribe antibiotics
                
a humidifier or steam can help loosen mucus and relieve wheezing and limited air flow if your bronchitis causes wheezing you may need an inhaled medicine to open your airways you take this medicine using an inhaler this device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs
                
your doctor also may prescribe medicines to relieve or reduce your cough and treat your inflamed airways especially if your cough persists
                
if you have chronic bronchitis and also have been diagnosed with copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease you may need medicines to open your airways and help clear away mucus these medicines include bronchodilators inhaled and steroids inhaled or pill form
                
if you have chronic bronchitis your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy this treatment can help you breathe easier and it provides your body with needed oxygen
                
one of the best ways to treat acute and chronic bronchitis is to remove the source of irritation and damage to your lungs if you smoke its very important to quit
                
talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking try to avoid secondhand smoke and other lung irritants such as dust fumes vapors and air pollution
                
for more information about how to quit smoking go to the diseases and conditions index smoking and your heart article and the national heart lung and blood institutes your guide to a healthy heart although these resources focus on heart health they include general information about how to quit smoking"
prevention,how to prevent asbestosrelated lung diseases ,"you can prevent asbestosrelated lung diseases by limiting your exposure to asbestos fibers if your job requires you to work around asbestos make sure to follow workplace rules for handling it for example make sure that air levels are measured and wear a proper respirator to avoid breathing in asbestos fibers
                
if you live in a house or work in a building that has pipes or other products containing asbestos you generally dont need to take special precautions being around products that contain asbestos isnt a danger as long as the asbestos is enclosed this prevents the fibers from getting into the air
                
if you smoke quit smoking greatly increases your risk of lung cancer if you have pleural plaque pleural effusion or asbestosis talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking also try to avoid secondhand smoke
                
if you have trouble quitting smoking on your own consider joining a support group many hospitals workplaces and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking
                
for more information about how to quit smoking go to the diseases and conditions index smoking and your heart article and the national heart lung and blood institutes your guide to a healthy heart although these resources focus on heart health they include general information about how to quit smoking"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of rh incompatibility ,"rh incompatibility doesnt cause signs or symptoms in a pregnant woman in a baby the condition can lead to hemolytic anemia hemolytic anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them
                
red blood cells contain hemoglobin heemuhglowbin an ironrich protein that carries oxygen to the body without enough red blood cells and hemoglobin the baby wont get enough oxygen
                
hemolytic anemia can cause mild to severe signs and symptoms in a newborn such as jaundice and a buildup of fluid
                
jaundice is a yellowish color of the skin and whites of the eyes when red blood cells die they release hemoglobin into the blood the hemoglobin is broken down into a compound called bilirubin this compound gives the skin and eyes a yellowish color high levels of bilirubin can lead to brain damage in the baby
                
the buildup of fluid is a result of heart failure without enough hemoglobincarrying red blood cells the babys heart has to work harder to move oxygenrich blood through the body this stress can lead to heart failure
                
heart failure can cause fluid to build up in many parts of the body when this occurs in a fetus or newborn the condition is called hydrops fetalis hidrops fetalis
                
severe hemolytic anemia can be fatal to a newborn at the time of birth or shortly after"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of insomnia ,"the main symptom of insomnia is trouble falling or staying asleep which leads to lack of sleep if you have insomnia you may
                
lie awake for a long time before you fall asleep
                
sleep for only short periods
                
be awake for much of the night

lofgrens syndrome is a classic set of signs and symptoms that is typical in some people who have sarcoidosis lofgrens syndrome may cause fever enlarged lymph nodes arthritis usually in the ankles andor erythema nodosum erihthema nodosum
                
erythema nodosum is a rash of red or reddishpurple bumps on your ankles and shins the rash may be warm and tender to the touch
                
treatment for sarcoidosis varies depending on which organs are affected your doctor may prescribe topical treatments andor medicines to treat the disease not everyone who has sarcoidosis needs treatment
                
outlook
                
the outlook for sarcoidosis varies many people recover from the disease with few or no longterm problems
                
more than half of the people who have sarcoidosis have remission within  years of diagnosis remission means the disease isnt active but it can return
                
twothirds of people who have the disease have remission within  years of diagnosis people who have lofgrens syndrome usually have remission relapse return of the disease  or more years after remission occurs in less than  percent of patients
                
sarcoidosis leads to organ damage in about onethird of the people diagnosed with the disease damage may occur over many years and involve more than one organ rarely sarcoidosis can be fatal death usually is the result of problems with the lungs heart or brain
                
poor outcomes are more likely in people who have advanced disease and show little improvement from treatment
                
certain people are at higher risk for poor outcomes from chronic longterm sarcoidosis this includes people who have lung scarring heart or brain complications or lupus pernio lupus purneo lupus pernio is a serious skin condition that sarcoidosis may cause
                
research is ongoing for new and better treatments for sarcoidosis"
susceptibility,who is at risk for thrombocytopenia ,"people who are at highest risk for thrombocytopenia are those affected by one of the conditions or factors discussed in what causes thrombocytopenia this includes people who
                
have certain types of cancer aplastic anemia or autoimmune diseases
                
are exposed to certain toxic chemicals
                
have a reaction to certain medicines
                
have certain viruses
                
have certain genetic conditions
                
people at highest risk also include heavy alcohol drinkers and pregnant women"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of immune thrombocytopenia ,"immune thrombocytopenia itp may not cause any signs or symptoms however itp can cause bleeding inside the body internal bleeding or underneath or from the skin external bleeding signs of bleeding may include
                
bruising or purplish areas on the skin or mucous membranes such as in the mouth these bruises are called purpura theyre caused by bleeding under the skin and they may occur for no known reason
                
pinpoint red spots on the skin called petechiae these spots often are found in groups and may look like a rash bleeding under the skin causes petechiae
                
a collection of clotted or partially clotted blood under the skin that looks or feels like a lump this is called a hematoma
                
nosebleeds or bleeding from the gums for example during dental work
                
blood in the urine or stool bowel movement
                
any kind of bleeding thats hard to stop could be a sign of itp this includes menstrual bleeding thats heavier than normal bleeding in the brain is rare and its symptoms may vary
                
a low platelet count doesnt directly cause pain problems concentrating or other symptoms however a low platelet count might be associated with fatigue tiredness"
causes,what causes arrhythmia ,"an arrhythmia can occur if the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are delayed or blocked this can happen if the special nerve cells that produce electrical signals dont work properly it also can happen if the electrical signals dont travel normally through the heart
                
an arrhythmia also can occur if another part of the heart starts to produce electrical signals this adds to the signals from the special nerve cells and disrupts the normal heartbeat
                
smoking heavy alcohol use use of some drugs such as cocaine or amphetamines use of some prescription or overthecounter medicines or too much caffeine or nicotine can lead to arrhythmias in some people
                
strong emotional stress or anger can make the heart work harder raise blood pressure and release stress hormones sometimes these reactions can lead to arrhythmias
                
a heart attack or other condition that damages the hearts electrical system also can cause arrhythmias examples of such conditions include high blood pressure coronary heart disease heart failure an overactive or underactive thyroid gland too much or too little thyroid hormone produced and rheumatic heart disease
                
congenital konjenihtal heart defects can cause some arrhythmias such as wolffparkinsonwhite syndrome the term congenital means the defect is present at birth
                
sometimes the cause of arrhythmias is unknown"
susceptibility,who is at risk for hypotension ,"hypotension can affect people of all ages however people in certain age groups are more likely to have certain types of hypotension
                
older adults are more likely to have orthostatic and postprandial hypotension children and young adults are more likely to have neurally mediated hypotension
                
people who take certain medicinessuch as diuretics water pills or other high blood pressure medicinesare at increased risk for hypotension certain conditions also increase the risk for hypotension examples include central nervous system disorders such as parkinsons disease and some heart conditions
                
other risk factors for hypotension include being immobile not being able to move around very much for long periods being out in the heat for a long time and pregnancy hypotension during pregnancy is normal and usually goes away after birth"
causes,what causes varicose veins ,"weak or damaged valves in the veins can cause varicose veins after your arteries and capillaries deliver oxygenrich blood to your body your veins return the blood to your heart the veins in your legs must work against gravity to do this
                
oneway valves inside the veins open to let blood flow through and then they shut to keep blood from flowing backward if the valves are weak or damaged blood can back up and pool in your veins this causes the veins to swell
                
weak vein walls may cause weak valves normally the walls of the veins are elastic stretchy if these walls become weak they lose their normal elasticity they become like an overstretched rubber band this makes the walls of the veins longer and wider and it causes the flaps of the valves to separate
                
when the valve flaps separate blood can flow backward through the valves the backflow of blood fills the veins and stretches the walls even more as a result the veins get bigger swell and often twist as they try to squeeze into their normal space these are varicose veins
                
normal vein and varicose vein
                

                
figure a shows a normal vein with a working valve and normal blood flow figure b shows a varicose vein with a deformed valve abnormal blood flow and thin stretched walls the middle image shows where varicose veins might appear in a leg
                
older age or a family history of varicose veins may raise your risk for weak vein walls you also may be at higher risk if you have increased pressure in your veins due to overweight or obesity or pregnancy"
exams and tests,how to diagnose thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ,"your doctor will diagnosis thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ttp based on your medical history a physical exam and test results
                
if ttp is suspected or diagnosed a hematologist will be involved in your care a hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood disorders
                
medical history
                
your doctor will ask about factors that may affect ttp for example he or she may ask whether you
                
have certain diseases or conditions such as cancer hiv lupus or infections or whether youre pregnant
                
have had previous medical procedures such as a blood and marrow stem cell transplant
                
take certain medicines such as ticlopidine clopidogrel cyclosporine a or hormone therapy and estrogens or whether youve had chemotherapy
                
have used any products that contain quinine quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products
                
physical exam
                
as part of the medical history and physical exam your doctor will ask about any signs or symptoms youve had he or she will look for signs such as
                
bruising and bleeding under your skin
                
fever
                
paleness or jaundice a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes
                
a fast heart rate
                
speech changes or changes in awareness that can range from confusion to passing out
                
changes in urine
                
diagnostic tests
                
your doctor also may recommend tests to help find out whether you have ttp
                
complete blood count
                
this test measures the number of red blood cells white blood cells and platelets in your blood for this test a sample of blood is drawn from a vein usually in your arm
                
if you have ttp youll have a lower than normal number of platelets and red blood cells anemia
                
blood smear
                
for this test a sample of blood is drawn from a vein usually in your arm some of your blood is put on a glass slide a microscope is then used to look at your red blood cells in ttp the red blood cells are torn and broken
                
platelet count
                
this test counts the number of platelets in a blood smear people who have ttp have a lower than normal number of platelets in their blood this test is used with the blood smear to help diagnose ttp
                
bilirubin test
                
when red blood cells die they release a protein called hemoglobin heemuhglowbin into the bloodstream the body breaks down hemoglobin into a compound called bilirubin high levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream cause jaundice
                
for this blood test a sample of blood is drawn from a vein usually in your arm the level of bilirubin in the sample is checked if you have ttp your bilirubin level may be high because your body is breaking down red blood cells faster than normal
                
kidney function tests and urine tests
                
these tests show whether your kidneys are working well if you have ttp your urine may contain protein or blood cells also your blood creatinine kreatihneen level may be high creatinine is a blood product thats normally removed by the kidneys
                
coombs test
                
this blood test is used to find out whether ttp is the cause of hemolytic anemia for this test a sample of blood is drawn from a vein usually in your arm
                
in ttp hemolytic anemia occurs because red blood cells are broken into pieces as they try to squeeze around blood clots
                
when ttp is the cause of hemolytic anemia the coombs test is negative the test is positive if antibodies proteins are destroying your red blood cells
                
lactate dehydrogenase test
                
this blood test measures a protein called lactate dehydrogenase ldh for this test a sample of blood is drawn from a vein usually in your arm
                
hemolytic anemia causes red blood cells to break down and release ldh into the blood ldh also is released from tissues that are injured by blood clots as a result of ttp
                
 assay
                
a lack of activity in the  enzyme causes ttp for this test a sample of blood is drawn from a vein usually in your arm the blood is sent to a special lab to test for the enzymes activity"
prevention,how to prevent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ,"both inherited and acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ttp occur suddenly with no clear cause you cant prevent either type
                
if youve had ttp watch for signs and symptoms of a relapse flareup for more information go to living with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
                
ask your doctor about factors that may trigger ttp or a flareup including
                
some diseases or conditions such as pregnancy cancer hiv lupus or infections
                
some medical procedures such as surgery and blood and marrow stem cell transplant
                
some medicines such as ticlopidine clopidogrel cyclosporine a chemotherapy and hormone therapy and estrogens if you take any of these medicines your doctor may prescribe a different medicine
                
quinine which is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products"
information,what is are mitral valve prolapse ,"mitral valve prolapse mvp is a condition in which the hearts mitral valve doesnt work well the flaps of the valve are floppy and may not close tightly these flaps normally help seal or open the valve
                
much of the time mvp doesnt cause any problems rarely blood can leak the wrong way through the floppy valve this can lead topalpitations shortness of breath chest pain and other symptoms palpitations are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat fluttering or beating too hard or too fast
                
normal mitral valve
                
the mitral valve controls blood flow between the upper and lower chambers of the left side of the heart the upper chamber is called the left atrium the lower chamber is called the left ventricle
                
the mitral valve allows blood to flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle but not back the other way the heart also has a right atrium and ventricle separated by the tricuspid valve
                
with each heartbeat the atria contract and push blood into the ventricles the flaps of the mitral and tricuspid valves open to let blood through then the ventricles contract to pump the blood out of the heart
                
when the ventricles contract the flaps of the mitral and tricuspid valves close they form a tight seal that prevents blood from flowing back into the atria
                
for more information go to the health topicshow the heart worksarticle this article contains animations that show how your heart pumps blood and how your hearts electrical system works
                
mitral valve prolapse
                
in mvp when the left ventricle contracts one or both flaps of the mitral valve flop or bulge back prolapse into the left atrium this can prevent the valve from forming a tight seal as a result blood may leak from the ventricle back into the atrium the backflow of blood is called regurgitation
                
mvp doesnt always cause backflow in fact most people who have mvp dont have backflow and never have any related symptoms or problems when backflow occurs it can get worse over time and itcan change the hearts size and raise pressure in the left atrium and lungs backflow also raises the risk of heart valve infections
                
medicines can treat troublesome mvp symptoms and help prevent complications some people will need surgery to repair or replace their mitral valves
                
mitral valve prolapse"
treatment,what are the treatments for mitral valve prolapse ,"most people who have mitral valve prolapse mvp dont need treatment because they dont have symptoms and complications
                
even people who do have symptoms may not need treatment the presence of symptoms doesnt always mean that the backflow of blood through the valve is significant
                
people who have mvp and troublesome mitral valve backflow may be treated with medicines surgery or both
                
the goals of treating mvp include
                
correcting the underlying mitral valve problem if necessary
                
preventinginfective endocarditisarrhythmias and other complications
                
relieving symptoms
                
medicines
                
medicines called beta blockers may be used to treatpalpitationsand chest discomfort in people who have little or no mitral valve backflow
                
if you have significant backflow and symptoms your doctor may prescribe
                
bloodthinning medicines to reduce the risk of blood clots forming if you haveatrial fibrillation
                
digoxin to strengthen your heartbeat
                
diuretics fluidpills to remove excess sodium and fluid in your body and lungs
                
medicines such as flecainide and procainamide to regulate your heart rhythms
                
vasodilators to widen your blood vessels and reduce your hearts workload examples of vasodilators are isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine
                
take all medicines regularly as your doctor prescribes dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to
                
surgery
                
surgery is done only if the mitral valve is very abnormal and blood is flowing back into the atrium the main goal of surgery is to improve symptoms and reduce the risk ofheart failure
                
the timing of the surgery is important if its done too early and your leaking valve is working fairly well you may be put at needless risk from surgery if its done too late you may have heart damage that cant be fixed
                
surgical approaches
                
traditionally heart surgeons repair or replace a mitral valve by making an incision cut in the breastbone and exposing the heart
                
a small but growing number of surgeons are using another approach that involves one or more small cuts through the side of the chest wall this results in less cutting reduced blood loss and a shorter hospital stay however not all hospitals offer this method
                
valve repair and valve replacement
                
in mitral valve surgery the valve is repaired or replaced valve repair is preferred when possible repair is less likely than replacement to weaken the heart repair also lowers the risk of infection and decreases the need for lifelong use of bloodthinning medicines
                
if repair isnt an option the valve can be replaced mechanical and biological valves are used as replacement valves
                
mechanical valves are manmade and can last a lifetime people who have mechanical valves must take bloodthinning medicines for the rest of their lives
                
biological valves are taken from cows or pigs or made from human tissue many people who have biological valves dont need to take bloodthinning medicines for the rest of their lives the major drawback of biological valves is that they weaken over time and often last only about  years
                
after surgery youll likely stay in the hospitals intensive care unit for  to  days overall most people who have mitral valve surgery spend about  to  weeks in the hospital complete recovery takes a few weeks to several months depending on your health before surgery
                
if youve had valve repair or replacement you may need antibiotics before dental work and surgery these procedures can allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream antibiotics can help prevent infective endocarditis a serious heart valve infection discuss with your doctor whether you need to take antibiotics before such procedures
                
transcatheter valve therapy
                
interventional cardiologists may be able to repair leaky mitral valves by implanting a device using a catheter tube inserted through a large blood vessel this approach is less invasive and can prevent a person from havingopenheart surgery at present the device is only approved for people with severe mitral regurgitation who cannot undergo surgery"
information,what is are broken heart syndrome ,"broken heart syndrome is a condition in which extreme stress can lead to heart muscle failure the failure is severe but often shortterm
                
most people who experience broken heart syndrome think they may be having a heart attack a more common medical emergency caused by a blocked coronary heart artery the two conditions have similar symptoms including chest pain and shortness of breath however theres no evidence of blocked coronary arteries in broken heart syndrome and most people have a full and quick recovery
                
overview
                
broken heart syndrome is a recently recognized heart problem it was originally reported in the asian population in  and named takotsubo cardiomyopathy kardeomiopahthee in this condition the heart is so weak that it assumes a bulging shape tako tsubo is the term for an octopus trap whose shape resembles the bulging appearance of the heart during this condition cases have since been reported worldwide and the first reports of broken heart syndrome in the united states appeared in  the condition also is commonly called stressinduced cardiomyopathy
                
the cause of broken heart syndrome is not fully known in most cases symptoms are triggered by extreme emotional or physical stress such as intense grief anger or surprise researchers think that the stress releases hormones that stun the heart and affect its ability to pump blood to the body the term stunned is often used to indicate that the injury to the heart muscle is only temporary
                
people who have broken heart syndrome often have sudden intense chest pain and shortness of breath these symptoms begin just a few minutes to hours after exposure to the unexpected stress many seek emergency care concerned they are having a heart attack often patients who have broken heart syndrome have previously been healthy
                
women are more likely than men to have broken heart syndrome researchers are just starting to explore what causes this disorder and how to diagnose and treat it
                
broken heart syndrome versus heart attack
                
symptoms of broken heart syndrome can look like those of a heart attack
                
most heart attacks are caused by blockages and blood clots forming in the coronary arteries which supply the heart with blood if these clots cut off the blood supply to the heart for a long enough period of time heart muscle cells can die leaving the heart with permanent damage heart attacks most often occur as a result of coronary heart disease chd also called coronary artery disease
                
broken heart syndrome is quite different most people who experience broken heart syndrome have fairly normal coronary arteries without severe blockages or clots the heart cells are stunned by stress hormones but not killed the stunning effects reverse quickly often within just a few days or weeks in most cases there is no lasting damage to the heart
                
because symptoms are similar to a heart attack it is important to seek help right away you and sometimes emergency care providers may not be able to tell that you have broken heart syndrome until you have some tests
                
all chest pain should be checked by a doctor if you think you or someone else may be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack dont ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help call  for emergency medical care in the case of a heart attack acting fast at the first sign of symptoms can save your life and limit damage to your heart
                
outlook
                
research is ongoing to learn more about broken heart syndrome and its causes
                
the symptoms of broken heart syndrome are treatable and most people who experience it have a full recovery usually within days or weeks the heart muscle is not permanently damaged and the risk of broken heart syndrome happening again is low"
causes,what causes bronchiectasis ,"damage to the walls of the airways usually is the cause of bronchiectasis a lung infection may cause this damage examples of lung infections that can lead to bronchiectasis include
                
severe pneumonia numoneah
                
whooping cough or measles uncommon in the united states due to vaccination
                
tuberculosis
                
fungal infections
                
conditions that damage the airways and raise the risk of lung infections also can lead to bronchiectasis examples of such conditions include
                
cystic fibrosis this disease leads to almost half of the cases of bronchiectasis in the united states
                
immunodeficiency disorders such as common variable immunodeficiency and less often hiv and aids
                
allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis asperjilosis this is an allergic reaction to a fungus called aspergillus the reaction causes swelling in the airways
                
disorders that affect cilia sileah function such as primary ciliary dyskinesia cilia are small hairlike structures that line your airways they help clear mucus a slimy substance out of your airways
                
chronic ongoing pulmonary aspiration aspihrashun this is a condition in which you inhale food liquids saliva or vomited stomach contents into your lungs aspiration can inflame the airways which can lead to bronchiectasis
                
connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis sjgrens syndrome and crohns disease
                
other conditions such as an airway blockage also can lead to bronchiectasis many things can cause a blockage such as a growth or a noncancerous tumor an inhaled object such as a piece of a toy or a peanut that you inhaled as a child also can cause an airway blockage
                
a problem with how the lungs form in a fetus may cause congenital bronchiectasis this condition affects infants and children"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of pneumonia ,"the signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe many factors affect how serious pneumonia is including the type of germ causing the infection and your age and overall health for more information go to who is at risk for pneumonia
                
see your doctor promptly if you
                
have a high fever
                
have shaking chills
                
have a cough with phlegm a slimy substance which doesnt improve or worsens
                
develop shortness of breath with normal daily activities
                
have chest pain when you breathe or cough
                
feel suddenly worse after a cold or the flu
                
people who have pneumonia may have other symptoms including nausea feeling sick to the stomach vomiting and diarrhea
                
symptoms may vary in certain populations newborns and infants may not show any signs of the infection or they may vomit have a fever and cough or appear restless sick or tired and without energy
                
older adults and people who have serious illnesses or weak immune systems may have fewer and milder symptoms they may even have a lower than normal temperature if they already have a lung disease it may get worse older adults who have pneumonia sometimes have sudden changes in mental awareness
                
complications of pneumonia
                
often people who have pneumonia can be successfully treated and not have complications but some people especially those in highrisk groups may have complications such as
                
bacteremia bakteremeah this serious complication occurs if the infection moves into your bloodstream from there it can quickly spread to other organs including your brain
                
lung abscesses an abscess occurs if pus forms in a cavity in the lung an abscess usually is treated with antibiotics sometimes surgery or drainage with a needle is needed to remove the pus
                
pleural effusion pneumonia may cause fluid to build up in the pleural space this is a very thin space between two layers of tissue that line the lungs and the chest cavity pneumonia can cause the fluid to become infecteda condition called empyema empiema if this happens you may need to have the fluid drained through a chest tube or removed with surgery"
prevention,how to prevent pneumonia ,"pneumonia can be very serious and even life threatening when possible take steps to prevent the infection especially if youre in a highrisk group
                
vaccines
                
vaccines are available to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia and the flu vaccines cant prevent all cases of infection however compared to people who dont get vaccinated those who do and still get pneumonia tend to have
                
milder cases of the infection
                
pneumonia that doesnt last as long
                
fewer serious complications

susceptibility,who is at risk for pernicious anemia ,"pernicious anemia is more common in people of northern european and african descent than in other ethnic groups
                
older people also are at higher risk for the condition this is mainly due to a lack of stomach acid and intrinsic factor which prevents the small intestine from absorbing vitamin  as people grow older they tend to make less stomach acid
                
pernicious anemia also can occur in younger people and other populations youre at higher risk for pernicious anemia if you
                
have a family history of the condition
                
have had part or all of your stomach surgically removed the stomach makes intrinsic factor this protein helps your body absorb vitamin 
                
have an autoimmune disorder that involves the endocrine glands such as addisons disease type  diabetes graves disease or vitiligo research suggests a link may exist between these autoimmune disorders and pernicious anemia thats caused by an autoimmune response
                
have had part or all of your small intestine surgically removed the small intestine is where vitamin  is absorbed
                
have certain intestinal diseases or other disorders that may prevent your body from properly absorbing vitamin  examples include crohns disease intestinal infections and hiv
                
take medicines that prevent your body from properly absorbing vitamin  examples of such medicines include antibiotics and certain seizure medicines
                
are a strict vegetarian who doesnt eat any animal or dairy products and doesnt take a vitamin  supplement or if you eat poorly overall"
causes,what causes sleep apnea ,"when youre awake throat muscles help keep your airway stiff and open so air can flow into your lungs when you sleep these muscles relax which narrows your throat
                
normally this narrowing doesnt prevent air from flowing into and out of your lungs but if you have sleep apnea your airway can become partially or fully blocked because
                
your throat muscles and tongue relax more than normal
                
your tongue and tonsils tissue masses in the back of your mouth are large compared with the opening into your windpipe
                
youre overweight the extra soft fat tissue can thicken the wall of the windpipe this narrows the inside of the windpipe which makes it harder to keep open
                
the shape of your head and neck bony structure may cause a smaller airway size in the mouth and throat area
                
the aging process limits your brain signals ability to keep your throat muscles stiff during sleep thus your airway is more likely to narrow or collapse
                
not enough air flows into your lungs if your airway is partially or fully blocked during sleep as a result loud snoring and a drop in your blood oxygen level can occur
                
if the oxygen drops to a dangerous level it triggers your brain to disturb your sleep this helps tighten the upper airway muscles and open your windpipe normal breathing then starts again often with a loud snort or choking sound
                
frequent drops in your blood oxygen level and reduced sleep quality can trigger the release of stress hormones these hormones raise your heart rate and increase your risk for high blood pressure heart attack stroke and arrhythmias irregular heartbeats the hormones also can raise your risk for or worsen heart failure
                
untreated sleep apnea also can lead to changes in how your body uses energy these changes increase your risk for obesity and diabetes"
exams and tests,how to diagnose sleep apnea ,"doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories a physical exam and sleep study results your primary care doctor may evaluate your symptoms first he or she will then decide whether you need to see a sleep specialist
                
sleep specialists are doctors who diagnose and treat people who have sleep problems examples of such doctors include lung and nerve specialists and ear nose and throat specialists other types of doctors also can be sleep specialists
                
medical and family histories
                
if you think you have a sleep problem consider keeping a sleep diary for  to  weeks bring the diary with you to your next medical appointment
                
write down when you go to sleep wake up and take naps also write down how much you sleep each night how alert and rested you feel in the morning and how sleepy you feel at various times during the day this information can help your doctor figure out whether you have a sleep disorder
                
you can find a sample sleep diary in the national heart lung and blood institutes your guide to healthy sleep
                
at your appointment your doctor will ask you questions about how you sleep and how you function during the day
                
your doctor also will want to know how loudly and often you snore or make gasping or choking sounds during sleep often youre not aware of such symptoms and must ask a family member or bed partner to report them
                
let your doctor know if anyone in your family has been diagnosed with sleep apnea or has had symptoms of the disorder
                
many people arent aware of their symptoms and arent diagnosed
                
if youre a parent of a child who may have sleep apnea tell your childs doctor about your childs signs and symptoms
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will check your mouth nose and throat for extra or large tissues children who have sleep apnea might have enlarged tonsils doctors may need only a physical exam and medical history to diagnose sleep apnea in children
                
adults who have sleep apnea may have an enlarged uvula uvuluh or soft palate the uvula is the tissue that hangs from the middle of the back of your mouth the soft palate is the roof of your mouth in the back of your throat
                
sleep studies
                
sleep studies are tests that measure how well you sleep and how your body responds to sleep problems these tests can help your doctor find out whether you have a sleep disorder and how severe it is sleep studies are the most accurate tests for diagnosing sleep apnea
                
there are different kinds of sleep studies if your doctor thinks you have sleep apnea he or she may recommend a polysomnogram polysomnogram also called a psg or a homebased portable monitor
                
polysomnogram
                
a psg is the most common sleep study for diagnosing sleep apnea this study records brain activity eye movements heart rate and blood pressure
                
a psg also records the amount of oxygen in your blood air movement through your nose while you breathe snoring and chest movements the chest movements show whether youre making an effort to breathe
                
psgs often are done at sleep centers or sleep labs the test is painless youll go to sleep as usual except youll have sensors attached to your scalp face chest limbs and a finger the staff at the sleep center will use the sensors to check on you throughout the night
                
a sleep specialist will review the results of your psg to see whether you have sleep apnea and how severe it is he or she will use the results to plan your treatment
                
your doctor also may use a psg to find the best setting for you on a cpap continuous positive airway pressure machine cpap is the most common treatment for sleep apnea a cpap machine uses mild air pressure to keep your airway open while you sleep
                
if your doctor thinks that you have sleep apnea he or she may schedule a splitnight sleep study during the first half of the night your sleep will be checked without a cpap machine this will show whether you have sleep apnea and how severe it is
                
if the psg shows that you have sleep apnea youll use a cpap machine during the second half of the splitnight study the staff at the sleep center will adjust the flow of air from the cpap machine to find the setting that works best for you
                
homebased portable monitor
                
your doctor may recommend a homebased sleep test with a portable monitor the portable monitor will record some of the same information as a psg for example it may record
                
the amount of oxygen in your blood
                
air movement through your nose while you breathe
                
your heart rate
                
chest movements that show whether youre making an effort to breathe
                
a sleep specialist may use the results from a homebased sleep test to help diagnose sleep apnea he or she also may use the results to decide whether you need a full psg study in a sleep center"

information,what is are atherosclerosis ,"espaol
                
atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygenrich blood to your heart and other parts of your body
                
plaque is made up of fat cholesterol calcium and other substances found in the blood over time plaque hardens and narrows your arteries this limits the flow of oxygenrich blood to your organs and other parts of your body
                
atherosclerosis can lead to serious problems including heart attack stroke or even death
                
atherosclerosis
                

                
atherosclerosisrelated diseases
                
atherosclerosis can affect any artery in the body including arteries in the heart brain arms legs pelvis and kidneys as a result different diseases may develop based on which arteries are affected
                
coronary heart disease
                
coronary heart disease chd also called coronary artery disease occurs when plaque builds up in the coronary arteries these arteries supply oxygenrich blood to your heart
                
plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle plaque buildup also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow
                
if blood flow to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked you may have angina chest pain or discomfort or a heart attack
                
plaque also can form in the hearts smallest arteries this disease is called coronary microvascular disease mvd in coronary mvd plaque doesnt cause blockages in the arteries as it does in chd
                
carotid artery disease
                
carotid karotid artery disease occurs if plaque builds up in the arteries on each side of your neck the carotid arteries these arteries supply oxygenrich blood to your brain if blood flow to your brain is reduced or blocked you may have a stroke
                
peripheral artery disease
                
peripheral artery disease pad occurs if plaque builds up in the major arteries that supply oxygenrich blood to your legs arms and pelvis
                
if blood flow to these parts of your body is reduced or blocked you may have numbness pain and sometimes dangerous infections
                
chronic kidney disease
                
chronic kidney disease can occur if plaque builds up in the renal arteries these arteries supply oxygenrich blood to your kidneys
                
over time chronic kidney disease causes a slow loss of kidney function the main function of the kidneys is to remove waste and extra water from the body
                
overview
                
the cause of atherosclerosis isnt known however certain traits conditions or habits may raise your risk for the disease these conditions are known as risk factors
                
you can control some risk factors such as lack of physical activity smoking and an unhealthy diet others you cant control such as age and a family history of heart disease
                
some people who have atherosclerosis have no signs or symptoms they may not be diagnosed until after a heart attack or stroke
                
the main treatment for atherosclerosis is lifestyle changes you also may need medicines and medical procedures these treatments along with ongoing medical care can help you live a healthier life
                
outlook
                
improved treatments have reduced the number of deaths from atherosclerosisrelated diseases these treatments also have improved the quality of life for people who have these diseases however atherosclerosis remains a common health problem
                
you may be able to prevent or delay atherosclerosis and the diseases it can cause making lifestyle changes and getting ongoing care can help you avoid the problems of atherosclerosis and live a long healthy life"
information,what is are coronary heart disease risk factors ,"coronary heart disease risk factors are conditions or habits that raise your risk of coronary heart disease chd and heart attack these risk factors also increase the chance that existing chd will worsen
                
chd also called coronary artery disease is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque plak builds up on the inner walls of the coronary arteries these arteries supply oxygenrich blood to your heart muscle
                
plaque narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle reduced blood flow can cause chest pain especially when youre active eventually an area of plaque can rupture break open this causes a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque
                
if the clot becomes large enough it can block the flow of oxygenrich blood to the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery blocked blood flow to the heart muscle causes a heart attack
                
overview
                
there are many known chd risk factors you can control some risk factors but not others risk factors you can control include
                
high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels a type of fat found in the blood
                
high blood pressure
                
diabetes and prediabetes
                
overweight and obesity
                
smoking
                
lack of physical activity
                
unhealthy diet
                
stress
                
the risk factors you cant control are age gender and family history of chd
                
many people have at least one chd risk factor your risk of chd and heart attack increases with the number of risk factors you have and their severity also some risk factors put you at greater risk of chd and heart attack than others examples of these risk factors include smoking and diabetes
                
many risk factors for coronary heart disease start during childhood this is even more common now because many children are overweight and dont get enough physical activity
                
researchers continue to study and learn more about chd risk factors
                
outlook
                
following a healthy lifestyle can help you and your children prevent or control many chd risk factors
                
because many lifestyle habits begin during childhood parents and families should encourage their children to make heart healthy choices for example you and your children can lower your risk of chd if you maintain a healthy weight follow a healthy diet do physical activity regularly and dont smoke
                
if you already have chd lifestyle changes can help you control your risk factors this may prevent chd from worsening even if youre in your seventies or eighties a healthy lifestyle can lower your risk of dying from chd
                
if lifestyle changes arent enough your doctor may recommend other treatments to help control your risk factors
                
your doctor can help you find out whether you have chd risk factors he or she also can help you create a plan for lowering your risk of chd heart attack and other heart problems
                
if you have children talk with their doctors about their heart health and whether they have chd risk factors if they do ask your doctor to help create a treatment plan to reduce or control these risk factors"
causes,what causes primary ciliary dyskinesia ,"primary ciliary dyskinesia pcd is a rare inherited disease inherited means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes with pcd this process is very complex researchers are still learning how the disease is inherited and which genes are involved
                
generally a child must inherit faulty genes from both parents to have pcd these genes affect how cilia grow and function cilia are tiny hairlike structures that line the airways
                
the airways include your nose and linked air passages mouth larynx laringks or voice box trachea trakeah or windpipe and tubes called bronchial tubes or bronchi and their branches
                
cilia move mucus a slimy substance through your airways and toward your mouth to be coughed or sneezed out of your body the mucus contains inhaled dust bacteria and other small particles
                
faulty genes may cause the cilia to be the wrong size or shape or move in the wrong way sometimes the cilia are missing altogether if the cilia dont work well bacteria stay in your airways this can cause breathing problems infections and other disorders
                
primary ciliary dyskinesia
                

                
no single faulty gene causes all cases of pcd rather many genes are associated with the disease
                
if a child inherits a faulty gene or genes from only one parent he or she may be a pcd carrier carriers usually have no symptoms of pcd however carriers can pass faulty pcd genes on to their children"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia ,"primary ciliary dyskinesia pcd mainly affects the sinuses ears and lungs one sign that you might have pcd is if you have chronic ongoing infections in one or more of these areas common signs symptoms and complications linked to pcd include the following
                
sinuses    chronic nasal congestion    runny nose with mucus and pus discharge    chronic sinus infections
                
chronic nasal congestion
                
runny nose with mucus and pus discharge
                
chronic sinus infections
                
ears    chronic middle ear infections    hearing loss
                
chronic middle ear infections
                
hearing loss
                
lungs    respiratory distress breathing problems in newborns    chronic cough    recurrent pneumonia    collapse of part or all of a lung
                
respiratory distress breathing problems in newborns
                
chronic cough
                
recurrent pneumonia
                
collapse of part or all of a lung
                
pcd also can cause fertility problems in men and women fertility refers to the ability to have children in men pcd can affect cilialike structures that help sperm cells move because the sperm cells dont move well men who have the disease usually are unable to father children
                
fertility problems also occur in some women who have pcd these problems likely are due to faulty cilia in the fallopian tubes the fallopian tubes carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus
                
about half of all people who have pcd have kartageners syndrome this syndrome involves three disorders chronic sinusitis sinusitis bronchiectasis brongkeektahsis and situs inversus
                
chronic sinusitis is a condition in which the sinuses are infected or inflamed the sinuses are hollow air spaces around the nasal passages
                
bronchiectasis is a condition in which damage to the airways causes them to widen and become flabby and scarred
                
situs inversus is a condition in which the internal organs for example the heart stomach spleen liver and gallbladder are in opposite positions from where they normally are
                
situs inversus can occur without pcd in fact only  percent of people who have the condition also have pcd by itself situs inversus may not affect your health however in pcd its a sign of kartageners syndrome
                
some people who have pcd have abnormally placed organs and congenital heart defects
                
when do symptoms occur
                
the symptoms and severity of pcd vary from person to person if you or your child has the disease you may have serious sinus ear andor lung infections if the disease is mild it may not show up until the teen or adult years
                
the symptoms and severity of pcd also vary over time sometimes you may have few symptoms other times your symptoms may become more severe
                
some people who have pcd have breathing problems when theyre born and need extra oxygen for several days afterward airway infections are common
                
diagnosing pcd in children can be hard this is because some pcd symptomssuch as ear infections chronic cough and runny noseare common in children even if they dont have pcd also the disease may be confused with another condition such as cystic fibrosis
                
a correct and early diagnosis of pcd is very important it will allow you or your child to get the proper treatment to keep your airways and lungs as healthy as possible an early diagnosis and proper treatment also can prevent or delay ongoing and longterm lung damage"
causes,what causes kawasaki disease ,"the cause of kawasaki disease isnt known the bodys response to a virus or infection combined with genetic factors may cause the disease however no specific virus or infection has been found and the role of genetics isnt known
                
kawasaki disease cant be passed from one child to another your child wont get it from close contact with a child who has the disease also if your child has the disease he or she cant pass it to another child"
prevention,how to prevent kawasaki disease ,kawasaki disease cant be prevented however most children who have the disease recoverusually within weeks of getting signs and symptoms further problems are rare
prevention,how to prevent metabolic syndrome ,"making hearthealthy lifestyle choices is the best way to prevent metabolic syndrome by
                
being physically active
                
following a hearthealthy eating plan

make sure to schedule routine doctor visits to keep track of your cholesterol blood pressure and blood sugar levels speak with your doctor about a blood test called a lipoprotein panel which shows your levels of total cholesterol ldl cholesterol hdl cholesterol and triglycerides"
causes,what causes pericarditis ,"in many cases the cause of pericarditis both acute and chronic is unknown
                
viral infections are likely a common cause of pericarditis although the virus may never be found pericarditis often occurs after a respiratory infection bacterial fungal and other infections also can cause pericarditis
                
most cases of chronic or recurring pericarditis are thought to be the result of autoimmune disorders examples of such disorders include lupus scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis
                
with autoimmune disorders the bodys immune system makes antibodies proteins that mistakenly attack the bodys tissues or cells
                
other possible causes of pericarditis are
                
heart attack and heart surgery
                
kidney failure hivaids cancer tuberculosis and other health problems
                
injuries from accidents or radiation therapy
                
certain medicines like phenytoin an antiseizure medicine warfarin and heparin bloodthinning medicines and procainamide a medicine to treat irregular heartbeats"
prevention,how to prevent obesity hypoventilation syndrome ,"you can prevent obesity hypoventilation syndrome ohs by maintaining a healthy weight however not everyone who is obese develops ohs researchers dont fully know why only some people who are obese develop the condition
                
adopting healthy habits can help you maintain a healthy weight many lifestyle habits begin during childhood so its important to make following a healthy lifestyle a family goal
                
a healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle a healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits it also includes whole grains fatfree or lowfat dairy products and protein foods such as lean meats eggs poultry without skin seafood nuts seeds beans and peas
                
a healthy diet is low in sodium salt added sugars solid fats and refined grains solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids refined grains come from processing whole grains which results in a loss of nutrients such as dietary fiber examples of refined grains include white rice and white bread

exams and tests,how to diagnose hemolytic anemia ,"your doctor will diagnose hemolytic anemia based on your medical and family histories a physical exam and test results
                
specialists involved
                
primary care doctors such as a family doctor or pediatrician may help diagnose and treat hemolytic anemia your primary care doctor also may refer you to a hematologist this is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and disorders
                
doctors and clinics that specialize in treating inherited blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemias also may be involved
                
if your hemolytic anemia is inherited you may want to consult a genetic counselor a counselor can help you understand your risk of having a child who has the condition he or she also can explain the choices that are available to you
                
medical and family histories
                
to find the cause and severity of hemolytic anemia your doctor may ask detailed questions about your symptoms personal medical history and your family medical history
                
he or she may ask whether
                
you or anyone in your family has had problems with anemia
                
youve recently had any illnesses or medical conditions
                
you take any medicines and which ones
                
youve been exposed to certain chemicals or substances
                
you have an artificial heart valve or other medical device that could damage your red blood cells
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will do a physical exam to check for signs of hemolytic anemia he or she will try to find out how severe the condition is and whats causing it
                
the exam may include
                
checking for jaundice a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes
                
listening to your heart for rapid or irregular heartbeats
                
listening for rapid or uneven breathing
                
feeling your abdomen to check the size of your spleen
                
doing a pelvic and rectal exam to check for internal bleeding
                
diagnostic tests and procedures
                
many tests are used to diagnose hemolytic anemia these tests can help confirm a diagnosis look for a cause and find out how severe the condition is
                
complete blood count
                
often the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count cbc the cbc measures many parts of your blood
                
this test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit heematohcrit levels hemoglobin is an ironrich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood a low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia
                
the normal range of these levels may vary in certain racial and ethnic populations your doctor can explain your test results to you
                
the cbc also checks the number of red blood cells white blood cells and platelets in your blood abnormal results may be a sign of hemolytic anemia a different blood disorder an infection or another condition
                
finally the cbc looks at mean corpuscular korpuskyular volume mcv mcv is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells the results may be a clue as to the cause of your anemia
                
other blood tests
                
if the cbc results confirm that you have anemia you may need other blood tests to find out what type of anemia you have and how severe it is
                
reticulocyte count a reticulocyte retikulosite count measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood the test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate
                
people who have hemolytic anemia usually have high reticulocyte counts because their bone marrow is working hard to replace the destroyed red blood cells
                
peripheral smear for this test your doctor will look at your red blood cells through a microscope some types of hemolytic anemia change the normal shape of red blood cells
                
coombs test this test can show whether your body is making antibodies proteins to destroy red blood cells
                
haptoglobin bilirubin and liver function tests when red blood cells break down they release hemoglobin into the bloodstream the hemoglobin combines with a chemical called haptoglobin a low level of haptoglobin in the bloodstream is a sign of hemolytic anemia
                
hemoglobin is broken down into a compound called bilirubin high levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream may be a sign of hemolytic anemia high levels of this compound also occur with some liver and gallbladder diseases thus you may need liver function tests to find out whats causing the high bilirubin levels
                
hemoglobin electrophoresis this test looks at the different types of hemoglobin in your blood it can help diagnose the type of anemia you have
                
testing for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria pnh in pnh the red blood cells are missing certain proteins the test for pnh can detect red blood cells that are missing these proteins
                
osmotic fragility test this test looks for red blood cells that are more fragile than normal these cells may be a sign of hereditary spherocytosis an inherited type of hemolytic anemia
                
testing for  dehydrogenase  deficiency in  deficiency the red blood cells are missing an important enzyme called  the test for  deficiency looks for this enzyme in a sample of blood
                
urine test
                
a urine test will look for the presence of free hemoglobin a protein that carries oxygen in the blood and iron
                
bone marrow tests
                
bone marrow tests show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough blood cells the two bone marrow tests are aspiration aspirashun and biopsy
                
for a bone marrow aspiration your doctor removes a small amount of fluid bone marrow through a needle the sample is examined under a microscope to check for faulty cells
                
a bone marrow biopsy may be done at the same time as an aspiration or afterward for this test your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a needle the tissue is examined to check the number and type of cells in the bone marrow
                
you may not need bone marrow tests if blood tests show whats causing your hemolytic anemia
                
tests for other causes of anemia
                
because anemia has many causes you may have tests for conditions such as
                
kidney failure
                
lead poisoning
                
vitamin or iron deficiency
                
newborn testing for sickle cell anemia and  deficiency
                
all states mandate screening for sickle cell anemia as part of their newborn screening programs some states also mandate screening for  deficiency these inherited types of hemolytic anemia can be detected with routine blood tests
                
diagnosing these conditions as early as possible is important so that children can get proper treatment"
prevention,how to prevent hemolytic anemia ,"you cant prevent inherited types of hemolytic anemia one exception is  dehydrogenase  deficiency
                
if youre born with  deficiency you can avoid substances that may trigger the condition for example avoid fava beans naphthalene a substance found in some moth balls and certain medicines as your doctor advises
                
some types of acquired hemolytic anemia can be prevented for example reactions to blood transfusions which can cause hemolytic anemia can be prevented this requires careful matching of blood types between the blood donor and the recipient
                
prompt and proper prenatal care can help you avoid the problems of rh incompatibility this condition can occur during pregnancy if a woman has rhnegative blood and her baby has rhpositive blood rhnegative and rhpositive refer to whether your blood has rh factor rh factor is a protein on red blood cells
                
rh incompatibility can lead to hemolytic anemia in a fetus or newborn"
susceptibility,who is at risk for fanconi anemia ,"fanconi anemia fa occurs in all racial and ethnic groups and affects men and women equally
                
in the united states about  out of every  people is an fa carrier this carrier rate leads to about  in  people being born with fa
                
two ethnic groups ashkenazi jews and afrikaners are more likely than other groups to have fa or be fa carriers
                
ashkenazi jews are people who are descended from the jewish population of eastern europe afrikaners are white natives of south africa who speak a language called afrikaans this ethnic group is descended from early dutch french and german settlers
                
in the united states  out of  ashkenazi jews is an fa carrier and  out of  is born with fa
                
major risk factors
                
fa is an inherited diseasethat is its passed from parents to children through genes at least  faulty genes are associated with fa fa occurs if both parents pass the same faulty fa gene to their child
                
children born into families with histories of fa are at risk of inheriting the disorder children whose mothers and fathers both have family histories of fa are at even greater risk a family history of fa means that its possible that a parent carries a faulty gene associated with the disorder
                
children whose parents both carry the same faulty gene are at greatest risk of inheriting fa even if these children arent born with fa theyre still at risk of being fa carriers
                
children who have only one parent who carries a faulty fa gene also are at risk of being carriers however theyre not at risk of having fa"
information,what is are atrial fibrillation ,"atrial fibrillation atreal fibrilashun or af is the most common type of arrhythmia ahrithmeah an arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat during an arrhythmia the heart can beat too fast too slow or with an irregular rhythm
                
af occurs if rapid disorganized electrical signals cause the hearts two upper chamberscalled the atria aytreeuhto fibrillate the term fibrillate means to contract very fast and irregularly
                
in af blood pools in the atria it isnt pumped completely into the hearts two lower chambers called the ventricles ventrihkuls as a result the hearts upper and lower chambers dont work together as they should
                
people who have af may not feel symptoms however even when af isnt noticed it can increase the risk of stroke in some people af can cause chest pain or heart failure especially if the heart rhythm is very rapid
                
af may happen rarely or every now and then or it may become an ongoing or longterm heart problem that lasts for years
                
understanding the hearts electrical system
                
to understand af it helps to understand the hearts internal electrical system the hearts electrical system controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat
                
with each heartbeat an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom as the signal travels it causes the heart to contract and pump blood
                
each electrical signal begins in a group of cells called the sinus node or sinoatrial sa node the sa node is located in the right atrium in a healthy adult heart at rest the sa node sends an electrical signal to begin a new heartbeat  to  times a minute this rate may be slower in very fit athletes
                
from the sa node the electrical signal travels through the right and left atria it causes the atria to contract and pump blood into the ventricles
                
the electrical signal then moves down to a group of cells called the atrioventricular av node located between the atria and the ventricles here the signal slows down slightly allowing the ventricles time to finish filling with blood
                
the electrical signal then leaves the av node and travels to the ventricles it causes the ventricles to contract and pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body the ventricles then relax and the heartbeat process starts all over again in the sa node
                
for more information about the hearts electrical system and detailed animations go to the diseases and conditions index how the heart works article
                
understanding the electrical problem in atrial fibrillation
                
in af the hearts electrical signals dont begin in the sa node instead they begin in another part of the atria or in the nearby pulmonary veins the signals dont travel normally they may spread throughout the atria in a rapid disorganized way this can cause the atria to fibrillate
                
the faulty signals flood the av node with electrical impulses as a result the ventricles also begin to beat very fast however the av node cant send the signals to the ventricles as fast as they arrive so even though the ventricles are beating faster than normal they arent beating as fast as the atria
                
thus the atria and ventricles no longer beat in a coordinated way this creates a fast and irregular heart rhythm in af the ventricles may beat  to  times a minute in contrast to the normal rate of  to  beats a minute
                
if this happens blood isnt pumped into the ventricles as well as it should be also the amount of blood pumped out of the ventricles to the body is based on the random atrial beats
                
the body may get rapid small amounts of blood and occasional larger amounts of blood the amount will depend on how much blood has flowed from the atria to the ventricles with each beat
                
most of the symptoms of af are related to how fast the heart is beating if medicines or age slow the heart rate the symptoms are minimized
                
af may be brief with symptoms that come and go and end on their own or the condition may be ongoing and require treatment sometimes af is permanent and medicines or other treatments cant restore a normal heart rhythm
                
the animation below shows atrial fibrillation click the start button to play the animation written and spoken explanations are provided with each frame use the buttons in the lower right corner to pause restart or replay the animation or use the scroll bar below the buttons to move through the frames
                

                

                
the animation shows how the hearts electrical signal can begin somewhere other than the sinoatrial node this causes the atria to beat very fast and irregularly
                
outlook
                
people who have af can live normal active lives for some people treatment can restore normal heart rhythms
                
for people who have permanent af treatment can help control symptoms and prevent complications treatment may include medicines medical procedures and lifestyle changes"
causes,what causes atrial fibrillation ,"atrial fibrillation af occurs if the hearts electrical signals dont travel through the heart in a normal way instead they become very rapid and disorganized
                
damage to the hearts electrical system causes af the damage most often is the result of other conditions that affect the health of the heart such as high blood pressure and coronary heart disease
                
the risk of af increases as you age inflammation also is thought to play a role in causing af
                
sometimes the cause of af is unknown"
susceptibility,who is at risk for angina ,"angina is a symptom of an underlying heart problem its usually a symptom of coronary heart disease chd but it also can be a symptom of coronary microvascular disease mvd so if youre at risk for chd or coronary mvd youre also at risk for angina
                
the major risk factors for chd and coronary mvd include
                
unhealthy cholesterol levels
                
high blood pressure
                
smoking
                
insulin resistance or diabetes
                
overweight or obesity
                
metabolic syndrome
                
lack of physical activity
                
unhealthy diet
                
older age the risk increases for men after  years of age and for women after  years of age
                
family history of early heart disease
                
for more detailed information about chd and coronary mvd risk factors visit the diseases and conditions index coronary heart disease coronary heart disease risk factors and coronary microvascular disease articles
                
people sometimes think that because men have more heart attacks than women men also suffer from angina more often in fact overall angina occurs equally among men and women
                
microvascular angina however occurs more often in women about  percent of the cases of microvascular angina occur in women around the time of menopause
                
unstable angina occurs more often in older adults variant angina is rare it accounts for only about  out of  cases of angina people who have variant angina often are younger than those who have other forms of angina"
exams and tests,how to diagnose asthma ,"your primary care doctor will diagnose asthma based on your medical and family histories a physical exam and test results
                
your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthmathat is whether its intermittent mild moderate or severe the level of severity will determine what treatment youll start on
                
you may need to see an asthma specialist if
                
you need special tests to help diagnose asthma
                
youve had a lifethreatening asthma attack
                
you need more than one kind of medicine or higher doses of medicine to control your asthma or if you have overall problems getting your asthma well controlled
                
youre thinking about getting allergy treatments
                
medical and family histories
                
your doctor may ask about your family history of asthma and allergies he or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur
                
let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places or if they get worse at night
                
your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them for more information about possible asthma triggers go to what are the signs and symptoms of asthma
                
your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management these conditions include a runny nose sinus infections reflux disease psychological stress and sleep apnea
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies these signs include wheezing a runny nose or swollen nasal passages and allergic skin conditions such as eczema
                
keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you dont have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you
                
diagnostic tests
                
lung function test
                
your doctor will use a test called spirometry spiromehtre to check how your lungs are working this test measures how much air you can breathe in and out it also measures how fast you can blow air out
                
your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved
                
if the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms your diagnosis will likely be asthma
                
other tests
                
your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis other tests may include
                
allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you if any
                
a test to measure how sensitive your airways are this is called a bronchoprovocation brongkopravehkashun test using spirometry this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in
                
a test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma such as reflux disease vocal cord dysfunction or sleep apnea
                
a chest x ray or an ekg electrocardiogram these tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms
                
diagnosing asthma in young children
                
most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before  years of age however asthma in young children aged  to  years can be hard to diagnose
                
sometimes its hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition this is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions
                
also many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections dont go on to have asthma after theyre  years old
                
a child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections the airways grow as the child grows older so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds
                
a young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if
                
one or both parents have asthma
                
the child has signs of allergies including the allergic skin condition eczema
                
the child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens
                
the child wheezes even when he or she doesnt have a cold or other infection
                
the most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test a medical history and a physical exam however its hard to do lung function tests in children younger than  years thus doctors must rely on childrens medical histories signs and symptoms and physical exams to make a diagnosis
                
doctors also may use a  week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds"
susceptibility,who is at risk for patent ductus arteriosus ,"patent ductus arteriosus pda is a relatively common congenital heart defect in the united states
                
the condition occurs more often in premature infants on average occurring in about  of every  births however pda also occurs in fullterm infants on average occurring in about  of every  births
                
pda also is more common in
                
infants who have genetic conditions such as down syndrome
                
infants whose mothers had german measles rubella during pregnancy
                
pda is twice as common in girls as it is in boys"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of sickle cell disease ,"early signs and symptoms
                
if a person has sickle cell disease scd it is present at birth but most infants do not have any problems from the disease until they are about  or  months of age every state in the united states the district of columbia and the us territories requires that all newborn babies receive screening for scd when a child has scd parents are notified before the child has symptoms
                
some children with scd will start to have problems early on and some later early symptoms of scd may include
                
painful swelling of the hands and feet known as dactylitis
                
fatigue or fussiness from anemia
                
a yellowish color of the skin known as jaundice or whites of the eyes known as icteris that occurs when a large number of red cells hemolyze
                
the signs and symptoms of scd will vary from person to person and can change over time most of the signs and symptoms of scd are related to complications of the disease
                
major complications of sickle cell disease
                
acute pain sickle cell or vasoocclusive crisis
                
pain episodes crises can occur without warning when sickle cells block blood flow and decrease oxygen delivery people describe this pain as sharp intense stabbing or throbbing severe crises can be even more uncomfortable than postsurgical pain or childbirth
                
pain can strike almost anywhere in the body and in more than one spot at a time but the pain often occurs in the
                
lower back
                
legs
                
arms
                
abdomen
                
chest
                
a crisis can be brought on by
                
illness
                
temperature changes
                
stress
                
dehydration not drinking enough
                
being at high altitudes
                
but often a person does not know what triggers or causes the crisis see acute pain management
                
chronic pain
                
many adolescents and adults with scd suffer from chronic pain this kind of pain has been hard for people to describe but it is usually different from crisis pain or the pain that results from organ damage
                
chronic pain can be severe and can make life difficult its cause is not well understood see chronic pain management
                
severe anemia
                
people with scd usually have mild to moderate anemia at times however they can have severe anemia severe anemia can be life threatening severe anemia in an infant or child with scd may be caused by
                
splenic sequestration crisis the spleen is an organ that is located in the upper left side of the belly the spleen filters germs in the blood breaks up blood cells and makes a kind of white blood cell a splenic sequestration crisis occurs when red blood cells get stuck in the spleen making it enlarge quickly since the red blood cells are trapped in the spleen there are fewer cells to circulate in the blood this causes severe anemia  a big spleen may also cause pain in the left side of the belly a parent can usuallypalpate or feel the enlarged spleen in the belly of his or her child
                
a big spleen may also cause pain in the left side of the belly a parent can usuallypalpate or feel the enlarged spleen in the belly of his or her child
                
aplastic crisis this crisis is usually caused by a parvovirus  infection also called fifth disease or slapped cheek syndrome parvovirus  is a very common infection but in scd it can cause the bone marrow to stop producing new red cells for a while leading to severe anemia
                
splenic sequestration crisis and aplastic crisis most commonly occur in infants and children with scd adults with scd may also experience episodes of severe anemia but these usually have other causes
                
no matter the cause severe anemia may lead to symptoms that include
                
shortness of breath
                
being very tired
                
feeling dizzy
                
having pale skin
                
babies and infants with severe anemia may feed poorly and seem very sluggish see anemia management
                
infections
                
the spleen is important for protection against certain kinds of germs sickle cells can damage the spleen and weaken or destroy its function early in life
                
people with scd who have damaged spleens are at risk for serious bacterial infections that can be lifethreatening some of these bacteria include
                
pneumococcus
                
hemophilus influenza type b
                
meningococcus
                
salmonella
                
staphylococcus
                
chlamydia
                
mycoplasma pneumoniae
                
bacteria can cause
                
blood infection septicemia
                
lung infection pneumonia

acute chest syndrome
                
sickling in blood vessels of the lungs can deprive a persons lungs of oxygen when this happens areas of lung tissue are damaged and cannot exchange oxygen properly this condition is known as acute chest syndrome in acute chest syndrome at least one segment of the lung is damaged
                
this condition is very serious and should be treated right away at a hospital
                
acute chest syndrome often starts a few days after a painful crisis begins a lung infection may accompany acute chest syndrome
                
symptoms may include
                
chest pain
                
fever
                
shortness of breath
                
rapid breathing
                
cough

brain complications
                
clinical stroke
                
a stroke occurs when blood flow is blocked to a part of the brain when this happens brain cells can be damaged or can die in scd a clinical stroke means that a person shows outward signs that something is wrong the symptoms depend upon what part of the brain is affected symptoms of stroke may include
                
weakness of an arm or leg on one side of the body
                
trouble speaking walking or understanding
                
loss of balance
                
severe headache
                
as many as  percent of people with hemoglobin ss and  percent of people with hemoglobin sc may suffer a clinical stroke by age 
                
in children clinical stroke occurs most commonly between the ages of  and  but recent prevention strategies have lowered the risk see transcranial doppler tcd ultrasound screening and red blood cell transfusions
                
when people with scd show symptoms of stroke their families or friends should call  right away see clinical stroke management
                
silent stroke and thinking problems
                
brain imaging and tests of thinking cognitive studies have shown that children and adults with hemoglobin ss and hemoglobin  thalassemia often have signs of silent brain injury also called silent stroke silent brain injury is damage to the brain without showing outward signs of stroke
                
this injury is common silent brain injury can lead to learning problems or trouble making decisions or holding down a job see cognitive screening and silent stroke management
                
eye problems
                
sickle cell disease can injure blood vessels in the eye
                
the most common site of damage is the retina where blood vessels can overgrow get blocked or bleed the retina is the lightsensitive layer of tissue that lines the inside of the eye and sends visual messages through the optic nerve to the brain
                
detachment of the retina can occur when the retina detaches it is lifted or pulled from its normal position these problems can cause visual impairment or loss see eye examinations
                
heart disease
                
people with scd can have problems with blood vessels in the heart and with heart function the heart can become enlarged people can also develop pulmonary hypertension
                
people with scd who have received frequent blood transfusions may also have heart damage from iron overload see transfusion management
                
pulmonary hypertension
                
in adolescents and adults injury to blood vessels in the lungs can make it hard for the heart to pump blood through them this causes the pressure in lung blood vessels to rise high pressure in these blood vessels is called pulmonary hypertension symptoms may include shortness of breath and fatigue
                
when this condition is severe it has been associated with a higher risk of death see screening for pulmonary hypertension
                
kidney problems
                
the kidneys are sensitive to the effects of red blood cell sickling
                
scd causes the kidneys to have trouble making the urine as concentrated as it should be this may lead to a need to urinate often and to have bedwetting or uncontrolled urination during the night nocturnal enuresis this often starts in childhood other problems may include
                
blood in the urine
                
decreased kidney function
                
kidney disease
                
protein loss in the urine
                
priapism
                
males with scd can have unwanted sometimes prolonged painful erections this condition is called priapism
                
priapism happens when blood flow out of the erect penis is blocked by sickled cells if it goes on for a long period of time priapism can cause permanent damage to the penis and lead to impotence
                
if priapism lasts for more than  hours emergency medical care should be sought to avoid complications see priapism management
                
gallstones
                
when red cells hemolyze they release hemoglobin hemoglobin gets broken down into a substance called bilirubin bilirubin can form stones that get stuck in the gallbladder the gallbladder is a small sacshaped organ beneath the liver that helps with digestion gallstones are a common problem in scd
                
gallstones may be formed early on but may not produce symptoms for years when symptoms develop they may include
                
rightsided upper belly pain
                
nausea
                
vomiting
                
if problems continue or recur a person may need surgery to remove the gallbladder
                
liver complications
                
there are a number of ways in which the liver may be injured in scd
                
sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis is an uncommon but severe form of liver damage that occurs when sickled red cells block blood vessels in the liver this blockage prevents enough oxygen from reaching liver tissue
                
these episodes are usually sudden and may recur children often recover but some adults may have chronic problems that lead to liver failure
                
people with scd who have received frequent blood transfusions may develop liver damage from iron overload
                
leg ulcers
                
sickle cell ulcers are sores that usually start small and then get larger and larger
                
the number of ulcers can vary from one to many some ulcers will heal quickly but others may not heal and may last for long periods of time some ulcers come back after healing
                
people with scd usually dont get ulcers until after the age of 
                
joint complications
                
sickling in the bones of the hip and less commonly the shoulder joints knees and ankles can decrease oxygen flow and result in severe damage this damage is a condition called avascular or aseptic necrosis this disease is usually found in adolescents and adults
                
symptoms include pain and problems with walking and joint movement a person may need pain medicines surgery or joint replacement if symptoms persist
                
delayed growth and puberty
                
children with scd may grow and develop more slowly than their peers because of anemia they will reach full sexual maturity but this may be delayed
                
pregnancy
                
pregnancies in women with scd can be risky for both the mother and the baby
                
mothers may have medical complications including
                
infections
                
blood clots
                
high blood pressure
                
increased pain episodes
                
they are also at higher risk for
                
miscarriages
                
premature births
                
smallfordates babies or underweight babies
                
see pregnancy management
                
mental health
                
as in other chronic diseases people with scd may feel sad and frustrated at times the limitations that scd can impose on a persons daily activities may cause them to feel isolated from others sometimes they become depressed
                
people with scd may also have trouble coping with pain and fatigue as well as with frequent medical visits and hospitalizations see living with emotional issues"
exams and tests,how to diagnose sickle cell disease ,"screening tests
                
people who do not know whether they make sickle hemoglobin hemoglobin s or another abnormal hemoglobin such as c  thalassemia e can find out by having their blood tested this way they can learn whether they carry a gene ie have the trait for an abnormal hemoglobin that they could pass on to a child
                
when each parent has this information he or she can be better informed about the chances of having a child with some type of sickle cell disease scd such as hemoglobin ss sc s thalassemia or others
                
newborn screening
                
when a child has scd it is very important to diagnose it early to better prevent complications
                
every state in the united states the district of columbia and the us territories require that every baby is tested for scd as part of a newborn screening program
                
in newborn screening programs blood from a heel prick is collected in spots on a special paper the hemoglobin from this blood is then analyzed in special labs
                
newborn screening results are sent to the doctor who ordered the test and to the childs primary doctor
                
if a baby is found to have scd health providers from a special followup newborn screening group contact the family directly to make sure that the parents know the results the child is always retested to be sure that the diagnosis is correct
                
newborn screening programs also find out whether the baby has an abnormal hemoglobin trait if so parents are informed and counseling is offered
                
remember that when a child has sickle cell trait or scd a future sibling or the childs own future child may be at risk these possibilities should be discussed with the primary care doctor a blood specialist called a hematologist andor a genetics counselor
                
prenatal screening
                
doctors can also diagnose scd before a baby is born this is done using a sample of amniotic fluid the liquid in the sac surrounding a growing embryo or tissue taken from the placenta the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mothers womb
                
testing before birth can be done as early as  weeks into the pregnancy this testing looks for the sickle hemoglobin gene rather than the abnormal hemoglobin"
information,what is are heart valve disease ,"heart valve disease occurs if one or more of your heart valves dont work well the heart has four valves the tricuspid pulmonary mitraland aortic valves
                
these valves have tissue flaps that open and close with each heartbeat the flaps make sure blood flows in the right direction through your hearts four chambers and to the rest of your body
                
healthy heart crosssection
                

                
birth defects agerelated changes infections or other conditions can cause one or more of your heart valves to not open fully or to let blood leak back into the heart chambers this can make your heart work harder and affect its ability to pump blood
                
overview
                
how the heart valves work
                
at the start of each heartbeat blood returning from the body and lungs fills the atria the hearts two upper chambers the mitral and tricuspid valves are located at the bottom of these chambers as the blood builds up in the atria these valves open to allow blood to flow into the ventricles the hearts two lower chambers
                
after a brief delay as the ventricles begin to contract the mitral and tricuspid valves shut tightly this prevents blood from flowing back into the atria
                
as the ventricles contract they pump blood through the pulmonary and aortic valves the pulmonary valve opens to allow blood to flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery this artery carries blood to the lungs to get oxygen
                
at the same time the aortic valve opens to allow blood to flow from the left ventricle into the aorta the aorta carries oxygenrich blood to the body as the ventricles relax the pulmonary and aortic valves shut tightly this prevents blood from flowing back into the ventricles
                
for more information about how the heart pumps blood and detailed animations go to the health topics how the heart works article
                
heart valve problems
                
heart valves can have three basic kinds of problems regurgitation stenosis and atresia
                
regurgitation or backflow occurs if a valve doesnt close tightly blood leaks back into the chambers rather than flowing forward through the heart or into an artery
                
in the united states backflow most often is due to prolapse prolapse is when the flaps of the valve flop or bulge back into an upper heart chamber during a heartbeat prolapse mainly affects the mitral valve
                
stenosis occurs if the flaps of a valve thicken stiffen or fuse together this prevents the heart valve from fully opening as a result not enough blood flows through the valve some valves can have both stenosis and backflow problems
                
atresia occurs if a heart valve lacks an opening for blood to pass through
                
some people are born with heart valve disease while others acquire it later in life heart valve disease that develops before birth is called congenitalheart valve disease congenital heart valve disease can occur alone or with other congenital heart defects
                
congenital heart valve disease often involves pulmonary or aortic valves that dont form properly these valves may not have enough tissue flaps they may be the wrong size or shape or they may lack an opening through which blood can flow properly
                
acquired heart valve disease usually involves aortic or mitral valves although the valves are normal at first problems develop over time
                
both congenital and acquired heart valve disease can cause stenosis or backflow
                
outlook
                
many people have heart valve defects or disease but dont have symptoms for some people the condition mostly stays the same throughout their lives and doesnt cause any problems
                
for other people heart valve disease slowly worsens until symptoms develop if not treated advanced heart valve disease can cause heart failure stroke blood clots or death due to sudden cardiac arrest sca
                
currently no medicines can cure heart valve disease however lifestyle changes and medicines can relieve many of its symptoms and complications 
                
these treatments also can lower your risk of developing a lifethreatening condition such as stroke or sca eventually you may need to have your faulty heart valve repaired or replaced
                
some types of congenital heart valve disease are so severe that the valve is repaired or replaced during infancy childhood or even before birth other types may not cause problems until middleage or older if at all"
causes,what causes heart valve disease ,"heart conditions and other disorders agerelated changes rheumatic fever or infections can cause acquired heart valve disease these factors change the shape or flexibility of oncenormal heart valves
                
the cause of congenital heart valve disease isnt known it occurs before birth as the heart is forming congenital heart valve disease can occur alone or with other types of congenital heartdefects
                
heart conditions and other disorders
                
certain conditions can stretch and distort the heart valves these conditions include
                
advanced high blood pressure and heart failure thiscan enlarge the heart or the main arteries
                
atherosclerosis in the aorta atherosclerosis is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the arteries the aorta is the main artery that carries oxygenrich blood to the body
                
damage and scar tissue due to a heart attack or injury to the heart
                
rheumatic fever
                
untreated strep throat or other infections with strep bacteria that progress to rheumatic fever can cause heart valve disease
                
when the body tries to fight the strep infection one or more heart valves may be damaged or scarred in the process the aortic and mitral valves most often are affected symptoms of heart valve damage often dont appear until many years after recovery from rheumatic fever
                
today most people who have strep infections are treated with antibiotics before rheumatic fever occurs if you have strep throat take all of the antibiotics your doctor prescribes even if you feel better before the medicine is gone
                
heart valve disease caused by rheumatic fever mainly affects older adults who had strep infections before antibiotics were available it also affects people from developing countries where rheumatic fever is more common
                
infections
                
common germs that enter the bloodstream and get carried to the heart can sometimes infect the inner surface of the heart including the heart valves this rare but serious infection is called infective endocarditis
                
the germs can enter the bloodstream through needles syringes or other medical devices and through breaks in the skin or gums often the bodys defenses fight off the germs and no infection occurs sometimes these defenses fail which leads to infective endocarditis
                
infective endocarditis can develop in people who already have abnormal blood flow through a heart valve as the result of congenital or acquired heart valve disease the abnormal blood flow causes blood clots to form on the surface of the valve the blood clots make it easier for germs to attach to and infect the valve
                
infective endocarditis can worsen existing heart valve disease
                
other conditions and factors linked to heart valve disease
                
many other conditions and factors are linked to heart valve disease however the role they play in causing heart valve disease often isnt clear
                
autoimmune disorders autoimmune disorders such as lupus can affect the aortic and mitral valves
                
carcinoid syndrome tumors in the digestive tract that spread to the liver or lymph nodes can affect the tricuspid and pulmonary valves
                
diet medicines the use of fenfluramine and phentermine fenphen sometimes has been linked to heart valve problems these problems typically stabilize or improve after the medicine is stopped
                
marfan syndrome congenital disorders such as marfan syndrome and other connective tissue disorders can affect the heart valves
                
metabolic disorders relatively uncommon diseases such as fabry disease and other metabolic disorders such as high blood cholesterol can affect the heart valves
                
radiation therapy radiation therapy to the chest area can cause heart valve disease this therapy is used to treat cancer heart valve disease due to radiation therapy may not cause symptoms until years after the therapy"
susceptibility,who is at risk for oxygen therapy ,"oxygen therapy can cause complications and side effects these problems might include a dry or bloody nose skin irritation from the nasal cannula or face mask fatigue tiredness and morning headaches
                
if these problems persist tell your doctor and home equipment provider depending on the problem your doctor may need to change your oxygen flow rate or the length of time youre using the oxygen
                
if nose dryness is a problem your doctor may recommend a nasal spray or have a humidifier added to your oxygen equipment
                
if you have an uncomfortable nasal cannula or face mask your home equipment provider can help you find a device that fits better your provider also can recommend overthecounter gels and devices that are designed to lessen skin irritation
                
complications from transtracheal oxygen therapy can be more serious with this type of oxygen therapy oxygen is delivered through a tube inserted into your windpipe through the front of your neck
                
with transtracheal oxygen therapy
                
mucus balls might develop on the tube inside the windpipe mucus balls tend to form as a result of the oxygen drying out the airways mucus balls can cause coughing and clog the windpipe or tube
                
problems with the tube slipping or breaking
                
infection
                
injury to the lining of the windpipe
                
proper medical care and correct handling of the tube and other supplies may reduce the risk of complications
                
other risks
                
in certain people oxygen therapy may suppress the drive to breathe affecting how well the respiratory system works this is managed by adjusting the oxygen flow rate
                
oxygen poses a fire risk so youll need to take certain safety steps oxygen itself isnt explosive but it can worsen a fire in the presence of oxygen a small fire can quickly get out of control also the cylinder that compressed oxygen gas comes in might explode if exposed to heat
                
your home equipment provider will give you a complete list of safety steps youll need to take at home and when out in public
                
for example when youre not using the oxygen keep it in an airy room never store compressed oxygen gas cylinders and liquid oxygen containers in small enclosed places such as in closets behind curtains or under clothes
                
oxygen containers let off small amounts of oxygen these small amounts can build up to harmful levels if theyre allowed to escape into small spaces"
information,what is are endocarditis ,"endocarditis endokarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves this lining is called the endocardium endokardeum the condition also is called infective endocarditis ie
                
the term endocarditis also is used to describe an inflammation of the endocardium due to other conditions this article only discusses endocarditis related to infection
                
ie occurs if bacteria fungi or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart the infection can damage your heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications
                
ie can develop quickly or slowly it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem when ie develops quickly its called acute infective endocarditis when it develops slowly its called subacute infective endocarditis
                
overview
                
ie mainly affects people who have
                
damaged or artificial manmade heart valves
                
congenital heart defects defects present at birth
                
implanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels
                
people who have normal heart valves also can have ie however the condition is much more common in people who have abnormal hearts
                
certain factors make it easier for bacteria to enter your bloodstream these factors put you at higher risk for ie for example poor dental hygiene and unhealthy teeth and gums increase your risk for the infection
                
other risk factors include using intravenous iv drugs having a catheter tube or another medical device in your body for long periods and having a history of ie
                
common symptoms of ie are fever and other flulike symptoms because the infection can affect people in different ways the signs and symptoms vary ie also can cause problems in many other parts of the body besides the heart
                
if youre at high risk for ie seek medical care if you have signs or symptoms of the infection especially a fever that persists or unexplained fatigue tiredness
                
outlook
                
ie is treated with antibiotics for several weeks you also may need heart surgery to repair or replace heart valves or remove infected heart tissue
                
most people who are treated with the proper antibiotics recover but if the infection isnt treated or if it persists despite treatment for example if the bacteria are resistant to antibiotics its usually fatal
                
if you have signs or symptoms of ie see your doctor as soon as you can especially if you have abnormal heart valves"

prevention,how to prevent hemochromatosis ,"you cant prevent primary or inherited hemochromatosis however not everyone who inherits hemochromatosis genes develops symptoms or complications of the disease in those who do treatments can keep the disease from getting worse
                
treatments include therapeutic phlebotomy iron chelation therapy dietary changes and other treatments for more information go to how is hemochromatosis treated
                
people who have hemochromatosis or a family history of it and are planning to have children may want to consider genetic testing and counseling testing will help show whether one or both parents have faulty hfe genes a genetic counselor also can help figure out the likelihood of the parents passing the faulty genes on to their children"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of pulmonary embolism ,"major signs and symptoms
                
signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism pe include unexplained shortness of breath problems breathing chest pain coughing or coughing up blood an arrhythmia irregular heartbeat also may suggest that you have pe
                
sometimes the only signs and symptoms are related to deep vein thrombosis dvt these include swelling of the leg or along a vein in the leg pain or tenderness in the leg a feeling of increased warmth in the area of the leg thats swollen or tender and red or discolored skin on the affected leg

some people who have pe have feelings of anxiety or dread lightheadedness or fainting rapid breathing sweating or an increased heart rate"
information,what is are aneurysm ,"an aneurysm anurism is a balloonlike bulge in an artery arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygenrich blood to your body
                
arteries have thick walls to withstand normal blood pressure however certain medical problems genetic conditions and trauma can damage or injure artery walls the force of blood pushing against the weakened or injured walls can cause an aneurysm
                
an aneurysm can grow large and rupture burst or dissect a rupture causes dangerous bleeding inside the body a dissection is a split in one or more layers of the artery wall the split causes bleeding into and along the layers of the artery wall
                
both rupture and dissection often are fatal
                
overview
                
most aneurysms occur in the aorta the main artery that carries oxygenrich blood from the heart to the body the aorta goes through the chest and abdomen
                
an aneurysm that occurs in the chest portion of the aorta is called a thoracic thorasik aortic aneurysm an aneurysm that occurs in the abdominal portion of the aorta is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm
                
aneurysms also can occur in other arteries but these types of aneurysm are less common this article focuses on aortic aneurysms
                
about  americans die each year from aortic aneurysms most of the deaths result from rupture or dissection
                
early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent rupture and dissection however aneurysms can develop and grow large before causing any symptoms thus people who are at high risk for aneurysms can benefit from early routine screening
                
outlook
                
doctors often can successfully treat aortic aneurysms with medicines or surgery if theyre found in time medicines may be given to lower blood pressure relax blood vessels and reduce the risk of rupture
                
large aortic aneurysms often can be repaired with surgery during surgery the weak or damaged portion of the aorta is replaced or reinforced"
susceptibility,who is at risk for aneurysm ,"certain factors put you at higher risk for an aortic aneurysm these factors include
                
male gender men are more likely than women to have aortic aneurysms
                
age the risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms increases as you get older these aneurysms are more likely to occur in people who are aged  or older
                
smoking smoking can damage and weaken the walls of the aorta
                
a family history of aortic aneurysms people who have family histories of aortic aneurysms are at higher risk for the condition and they may have aneurysms before the age of 
                
a history of aneurysms in the arteries of the legs
                
certain diseases and conditions that weaken the walls of the aorta examples include high blood pressure and atherosclerosis
                
having a bicuspid aortic valve can raise the risk of having a thoracic aortic aneurysm a bicuspid aortic valve has two leaflets instead of the typical three
                
car accidents or trauma also can injure the arteries and increase the risk for aneurysms
                
if you have any of these risk factors talk with your doctor about whether you need screening for aneurysms"
treatment,what are the treatments for aneurysm ,"aortic aneurysms are treated with medicines and surgery small aneurysms that are found early and arent causing symptoms may not need treatment other aneurysms need to be treated
                
the goals of treatment may include
                
preventing the aneurysm from growing
                
preventing or reversing damage to other body structures
                
preventing or treating a rupture or dissection
                
allowing you to continue doing your normal daily activities
                
treatment for an aortic aneurysm is based on its size your doctor may recommend routine testing to make sure an aneurysm isnt getting bigger this method usually is used for aneurysms that are smaller than  centimeters about  inches across
                
how often you need testing for example every few months or every year is based on the size of the aneurysm and how fast its growing the larger it is and the faster its growing the more often you may need to be checked
                
medicines
                
if you have an aortic aneurysm your doctor may prescribe medicines before surgery or instead of surgery medicines are used to lower blood pressure relax blood vessels and lower the risk that the aneurysm will rupture burst beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are the medicines most commonly used
                
surgery
                
your doctor may recommend surgery if your aneurysm is growing quickly or is at risk of rupture or dissection
                
the two main types of surgery to repair aortic aneurysms are open abdominal or open chest repair and endovascular repair
                
open abdominal or open chest repair
                
the standard and most common type of surgery for aortic aneurysms is open abdominal or open chest repair this surgery involves a major incision cut in the abdomen or chest
                
general anesthesia anesthezeah is used during this procedure the term anesthesia refers to a loss of feeling and awareness general anesthesia temporarily puts you to sleep
                
during the surgery the aneurysm is removed then the section of aorta is replaced with a graft made of material such as dacron or teflon the surgery takes  to  hours youll remain in the hospital for  to  days
                
if needed repair of the aortic heart valve also may be done during open abdominal or open chest surgery
                
it often takes a month to recover from open abdominal or open chest surgery and return to full activity most patients make a full recovery
                
endovascular repair
                
in endovascular repair the aneurysm isnt removed instead a graft is inserted into the aorta to strengthen it surgeons do this type of surgery using catheters tubes inserted into the arteries it doesnt require surgically opening the chest or abdomen general anesthesia is used during this procedure
                
the surgeon first inserts a catheter into an artery in the groin upper thigh and threads it to the aneurysm then using an x ray to see the artery the surgeon threads the graft also called a stent graft into the aorta to the aneurysm
                
the graft is then expanded inside the aorta and fastened in place to form a stable channel for blood flow the graft reinforces the weakened section of the aorta this helps prevent the aneurysm from rupturing
                
endovascular repair
                

                
the illustration shows the placement of a stent graft in an aortic aneurysm in figure a a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin upper thigh the catheter is threaded to the abdominal aorta and the stent graft is released from the catheter in figure b the stent graft allows blood to flow through the aneurysm
                
the recovery time for endovascular repair is less than the recovery time for open abdominal or open chest repair however doctors cant repair all aortic aneurysms with endovascular repair the location or size of an aneurysm may prevent the use of a stent graft"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of deep vein thrombosis ,"the signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis dvt might be related to dvt itself or pulmonary embolism pe see your doctor right away if you have signs or symptoms of either condition both dvt and pe can cause serious possibly lifethreatening problems if not treated
                
deep vein thrombosis
                
only about half of the people who have dvt have signs and symptoms these signs and symptoms occur in the leg affected by the deep vein clot they include
                
swelling of the leg or along a vein in the leg
                
pain or tenderness in the leg which you may feel only when standing or walking

susceptibility,who is at risk for heart palpitations ,"some people may be more likely than others to have palpitations people at increased risk include those who
                
have anxiety or panic attacks or people who are highly stressed
                
take certain medicines or stimulants
                
have certain medical conditions that arent related to heart problems such as an overactive thyroid
                
have certain heart problems such as arrhythmias irregular heartbeats a previous heart attack heart failure heart valve disease or heart muscle disease
                
women who are pregnant menstruating or perimenopausal also may be at higher risk for palpitations because of hormonal changes some palpitations that occur during pregnancy may be due to anemia
                
for more information about these risk factors go to what causes palpitations"
exams and tests,how to diagnose bronchopulmonary dysplasia ,"infants who are born earlyusually more than  weeks before their due datesand still need oxygen therapy by the time they reach their original due dates are diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd
                
bpd can be mild moderate or severe the diagnosis depends on how much extra oxygen a baby needs at the time of his or her original due date it also depends on how long the baby needs oxygen therapy
                
to help confirm a diagnosis of bpd doctors may recommend tests such as
                
chest x ray a chest x ray takes pictures of the structures inside the chest such as the heart and lungs in severe cases of bpd this test may show large areas of air and signs of inflammation or infection in the lungs a chest x ray also can detect problems such as a collapsed lung and show whether the lungs arent developing normally
                
blood tests blood tests are used to see whether an infant has enough oxygen in his or her blood blood tests also can help determine whether an infection is causing an infants breathing problems
                
echocardiography this test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart echocardiography is used to rule out heart defects or pulmonary hypertension as the cause of an infants breathing problems"
susceptibility,who is at risk for cardiomyopathy ,"people of all ages and races can have cardiomyopathy however certain types of the disease are more common in certain groups
                
dilated cardiomyopathy is more common in african americans than whites this type of the disease also is more common in men than women
                
teens and young adults are more likely than older people to have arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia although its rare in both groups
                
major risk factors
                
certain diseases conditions or factors can raise your risk for cardiomyopathy major risk factors include
                
a family history of cardiomyopathy heart failure or sudden cardiac arrest sca
                
a disease or condition that can lead to cardiomyopathy such as coronary heart disease heart attack or a viral infection that inflames the heart muscle
                
diabetes or other metabolic diseases or severe obesity
                
diseases that can damage the heart such as hemochromatosis sarcoidosis or amyloidosis
                
longterm alcoholism
                
longterm high blood pressure
                
some people who have cardiomyopathy never have signs or symptoms thus its important to identify people who may be at high risk for the disease this can help prevent future problems such as serious arrhythmias irregular heartbeats or sca"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of cardiomyopathy ,"some people who have cardiomyopathy never have signs or symptoms others dont have signs or symptoms in the early stages of the disease
                
as cardiomyopathy worsens and the heart weakens signs and symptoms of heart failure usually occur these signs and symptoms include

when signs and symptoms do occur they can range from mild to severe many of the signs and symptoms of irondeficiency anemia apply to all types of anemia
                
signs and symptoms of anemia
                
the most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue tiredness fatigue occurs because your body doesnt have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its many parts
                
also the red blood cells your body makes have less hemoglobin than normal hemoglobin is an ironrich protein in red blood cells it helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body
                
anemia also can cause shortness of breath dizziness headache coldness in your hands and feet pale skin chest pain weakness and fatigue tiredness
                
if you dont have enough hemoglobincarrying red blood cells your heart has to work harder to move oxygenrich blood through your body this can lead to irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias ahrithmeahs a heart murmur an enlarged heart or even heart failure
                
in infants and young children signs of anemia include poor appetite slowed growth and development and behavioral problems
                
signs and symptoms of iron deficiency
                
signs and symptoms of iron deficiency may include brittle nails swelling or soreness of the tongue cracks in the sides of the mouth an enlarged spleen and frequent infections
                
people who have irondeficiency anemia may have an unusual craving for nonfood items such as ice dirt paint or starch this craving is called pica pika or peka
                
some people who have irondeficiency anemia develop restless legs syndrome rls rls is a disorder that causes a strong urge to move the legs this urge to move often occurs with strange and unpleasant feelings in the legs people who have rls often have a hard time sleeping
                
irondeficiency anemia can put children at greater risk for lead poisoning and infections
                
some signs and symptoms of irondeficiency anemia are related to the conditions causes for example a sign of intestinal bleeding is bright red blood in the stools or black tarrylooking stools
                
very heavy menstrual bleeding long periods or other vaginal bleeding may suggest that a woman is at risk for irondeficiency anemia"

symptoms,what are the symptoms of marfan syndrome ,"marfan syndrome can affect many parts of the body as a result the signs and symptoms of the disorder vary from person to person even in the same family
                
marfan complications also vary depending on how the condition affects your body marfan syndrome most often affects the connective tissue of the heart eyes bones lungs and covering of the spinal cord this can cause many complications some of which are life threatening
                
marfan traits
                
marfan syndrome often affects the long bones of the body this can lead to signs or traits such as
                
a tall thin build
                
long arms legs fingers and toes and flexible joints
                
a spine that curves to one side this condition is called scoliosis
                
a chest that sinks in or sticks out these conditions are called pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum respectively
                
teeth that are too crowded
                
flat feet
                
stretch marks on the skin also are a common trait in people who have marfan syndrome stretch marks usually appear on the lower back buttocks shoulders breasts thighs and abdomen
                
not everyone who has these traits has marfan syndrome some of these traits also are signs of other connective tissue disorders
                
complications of marfan syndrome
                
heart and blood vessel complications
                
the most serious complications of marfan syndrome involve the heart and blood vessels
                
marfan syndrome can affect the aorta the main blood vessel that supplies oxygenrich blood to the body in marfan syndrome the aorta can stretch and grow weak this condition is called aortic dilation or aortic aneurysm
                
if the aorta stretches and grows weak it may tear and leak blood this condition called aortic dissection can lead to severe heart problems or even death
                
aortic dissection can cause severe pain in either the front or back of the chest or abdomen the pain can travel upward or downward if you have symptoms of aortic dissection call 
                
marfan syndrome also can cause problems with the hearts mitral mitrul valve this valve controls blood flow between the upper and lower chambers on the left side of the heart marfan syndrome can lead to mitral valve prolapse mvp
                
mvp is a condition in which the flaps of the mitral valve are floppy and dont close tightly mvp can cause shortness of breath palpitations palpitashuns chest pain and other symptoms
                
if you have mvp your doctor may hear a heart murmur if he or she listens to your heart with a stethoscope a heart murmur is an extra or unusual sound heard during the heartbeat
                
eye complications
                
marfan syndrome can cause many eye problems a common problem in marfan syndrome is a dislocated lens in one or both of the eyes in this condition the lens the part of the eye that helps focus light shifts up down or to the side this can affect your eyesight a dislocated lens often is the first sign that someone has marfan syndrome
                
other eye complications of marfan syndrome include nearsightedness early glaucoma high pressure in the fluid in the eyes and early cataracts clouding of an eyes lens a detached retina also can occur
                
nervous system complications
                
fluid surrounds your brain and spinal cord a substance called dura covers the fluid in marfan syndrome the dura can stretch and grow weak
                
this condition called dural ectasia ektazeah can occur in people who have marfan syndrome as they grow older eventually the bones of the spine may wear away
                
symptoms of this condition are lower back pain abdominal pain headache and numbness in the legs
                
lung complications
                
marfan syndrome can cause sudden pneumothorax noomothoraks or collapsed lung in this condition air or gas builds up in the space between the lungs and chest wall if enough air or gas builds up a lung can collapse
                
the most common symptoms of a collapsed lung are sudden pain in one side of the lung and shortness of breath
                
conditions such as scoliosis a curved spine and pectus excavatum a chest that sinks in can prevent the lungs from expanding fully this can cause breathing problems marfan syndrome also can cause changes in the lung tissue and it can lead to early emphysema emfisema
                
marfan syndrome also has been linked to sleep apnea in people who have marfan syndrome the shape of the face oral cavity or teeth may increase the risk of sleep apnea sleep apnea causes one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep
                
breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes they often occur  to  times or more an hour typically normal breathing then starts again sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound"
exams and tests,how to diagnose marfan syndrome ,"your doctor will diagnose marfan syndrome based on your medical and family histories a physical exam and test results he or she also will consult a set of guidelines called ghent criteria which are used to diagnose marfan syndrome
                
marfan syndrome can be hard to diagnose this is because its signs or traits are the same as or similar to the signs of other connective tissue disorders
                
if youre diagnosed with marfan syndrome all of your firstdegree relatives for example parents siblings and children also should be checked for the disorder this is because even in families the outward traits of marfan syndrome may vary quite a bit
                
specialists involved
                
your family doctor or another type of doctor such as an orthopedist bone specialist may notice certain traits that suggest marfan syndrome

ghent criteria
                
because no single test can diagnose marfan syndrome doctors use a set of guidelines called ghent criteria to help diagnose the condition the ghent criteria are divided into major criteria and minor criteria sometimes genetic testing is part of this evaluation
                
major criteria include traits that are common in people who have marfan syndrome minor criteria include traits that are common in many people doctors use a scoring system based on the number and type of ghent criteria present to diagnose marfan syndrome

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to cole disease ,cole disease is caused by mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps to prevent minerals including calcium from being deposited in body tissues where they do not belong it also plays a role in controlling cell signaling in response to the hormone insulin through interaction between a part of the  protein called the  domain and the insulin receptor the insulin receptor is a protein that attaches binds to insulin and initiates cell signaling  insulin plays many roles in the body including regulating blood sugar levels by controlling how much sugar in the form of glucose is passed from the bloodstream into cells to be used as energy cell signaling in response to insulin is also important for the maintenance of the outer layer of skin the epidermis it helps control the transport of the pigment melanin from the cells in which it is produced melanocytes to epidermal cells called keratinocytes and it is also involved in the development of keratinocytes  the mutations that cause cole disease change the structure of the  domain which alters its interaction with the insulin receptor and affects cell signaling the resulting impairment of  role in melanin transport and keratinocyte development leads to the hypopigmentation and keratoderma that occurs in cole disease the mutations may also impair  control of calcification which likely accounts for the abnormal calcium deposits that occur in some people with this disorder for reasons that are unclear the changes in insulin signaling resulting from these  gene mutations do not seem to affect blood sugar control
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to congenital central hypoventilation syndrome ,mutations in the  gene cause cchs the  gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts early in development to help promote the formation of nerve cells neurons and regulate the process by which the neurons mature to carry out specific functions differentiation the protein is active in the neural crest which is a group of cells in the early embryo that give rise to many tissues and organs neural crest cells migrate to form parts of the autonomic nervous system many tissues in the face and skull and other tissue and cell types  mutations are believed to interfere with the  proteins role in promoting neuron formation and differentiation especially in the autonomic nervous system resulting in the problems regulating breathing and other body functions that occur in cchs
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to aicardi syndrome ,the cause of aicardi syndrome is unknown because it occurs almost exclusively in females researchers believe that it is probably the result of a mutation in a gene on the x chromosome people normally have  chromosomes in each cell two of the  chromosomes known as x and y are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics genes on these chromosomes are also involved in other functions in the body females typically have two x chromosomes  and males have one x chromosome and one y chromosome   early in embryonic development in females one of the two x chromosomes is permanently inactivated in somatic cells cells other than egg and sperm cells xinactivation ensures that females like males have only one active copy of the x chromosome in each body cell usually xinactivation occurs randomly so that each x chromosome is active in about half the bodys cells sometimes xinactivation is not random and one x chromosome is active in more than half of cells when xinactivation does not occur randomly it is called skewed xinactivation  skewed xinactivation sometimes occurs when there is a severe gene mutation in one of the x chromosomes in each cell because the cells where this chromosome is active will not be able to survive as well xinactivation will appear to be skewed skewed xinactivation has been identified in girls with aicardi syndrome further supporting the idea that the disorder is caused by a mutation in a gene on the x chromosome however this gene has not been identified and it is unknown how the genetic change that causes aicardi syndrome results in the various signs and symptoms of this disorder

information,what is are silver syndrome ,silver syndrome belongs to a group of genetic disorders known as hereditary spastic paraplegias these disorders are characterized by progressive muscle stiffness spasticity and frequently development of paralysis of the lower limbs paraplegia hereditary spastic paraplegias are divided into two types pure and complex both types involve the lower limbs the complex types may also involve the upper limbs although to a lesser degree in addition the complex types may affect the brain and parts of the nervous system involved in muscle movement and sensations silver syndrome is a complex hereditary spastic paraplegia  the first sign of silver syndrome is usually weakness in the muscles of the hands these muscles waste away amyotrophy resulting in abnormal positioning of the thumbs and difficulty using the fingers and hands for tasks such as handwriting people with silver syndrome often have higharched feet pes cavus and spasticity in the legs the signs and symptoms of silver syndrome typically begin in late childhood but can start anytime from early childhood to late adulthood the muscle problems associated with silver syndrome slowly worsen with age but affected individuals can remain active throughout life
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to silver syndrome ,mutations in the  gene cause silver syndrome the  gene provides instructions for making a protein called seipin whose function is unknown the  gene is active expressed in cells throughout the body particularly in nerve cells that control muscle movement motor neurons and in brain cells within cells seipin is found in the membrane of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum which is involved in protein processing and transport   gene mutations that cause silver syndrome likely lead to an alteration in the structure of seipin causing it to fold into an incorrect  shape research findings indicate that misfolded seipin proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum this accumulation likely damages and kills motor neurons which leads to muscle weakness and spasticity in silver syndrome only specific motor neurons are involved resulting in the hand and leg muscles being solely affected  some people with silver syndrome do not have an identified mutation in the  gene the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown
inheritance,is  duplication syndrome inherited , duplication syndrome is inherited in an xlinked pattern the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome which is one of the two sex chromosomes in males who have only one x chromosome a duplication of the only copy of the  gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition in females who have two x chromosomes a duplication of one of the two copies of the gene typically does not cause the disorder females usually do not have signs and symptoms of  duplication syndrome because the x chromosome that contains the duplication may be turned off inactive due to a process called xinactivation  early in embryonic development in females one of the two x chromosomes is permanently inactivated in somatic cells cells other than egg and sperm cells xinactivation ensures that females like males have only one active copy of the x chromosome in each body cell usually xinactivation occurs randomly such that each x chromosome is active in about half of the body cells sometimes xinactivation is not random and one x chromosome is active in more than half of cells when xinactivation does not occur randomly it is called skewed xinactivation  research shows that females with an  gene duplication have skewed xinactivation which results in the inactivation of the x chromosome containing the duplication in most cells of the body this skewed x inactivation ensures that only the chromosome with the normal  gene is expressed this skewed xinactivation is why females with an  gene duplication typically do not have any features related to the additional genetic material

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to mucopolysaccharidosis type vii ,mutations in the gusb gene cause mps vii this gene provides instructions for producing the betaglucuronidase glucuronidase enzyme which is involved in the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans gags gags were originally called mucopolysaccharides which is where this condition gets its name mutations in the gusb gene reduce or completely eliminate the function of glucuronidase the shortage deficiency of glucuronidase leads to the accumulation of gags within cells specifically inside the lysosomes lysosomes are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle different types of molecules conditions such as mps vii that cause molecules to build up inside the lysosomes are called lysosomal storage disorders the accumulation of gags increases the size of the lysosomes which is why many tissues and organs are enlarged in this disorder researchers believe that the gags may also interfere with the functions of other proteins inside the lysosomes and disrupt many normal functions of cells
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to taskspecific focal dystonia ,the causes of taskspecific focal dystonia are unknown although the disorder likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors certain genetic changes probably increase the likelihood of developing this condition and environmental factors may trigger the onset of symptoms in people who are at risk it is possible that the different forms of taskspecific focal dystonia have different underlying causes  having a family history of dystonia particularly focal dystonia is one of the only established risk factors for taskspecific focal dystonia studies suggest that previous injury changes in practice routine and exposure to antipsychotic drugs which can cause other types of dystonia are not major risk factors nor does the condition appear to be a form of performance anxiety taskspecific focal dystonia may be associated with dysfunction in areas of the brain that regulate movement in particular researchers have found that at least some cases of the condition are related to malfunction of the basal ganglia which are structures deep within the brain that help start and control movement  although genetic factors are almost certainly involved in taskspecific focal dystonia no genes have been clearly associated with the condition researchers have looked for mutations in several genes known to be involved in other forms of dystonia but these genetic changes do not appear to be a major cause of taskspecific focal dystonia researchers are working to determine which genetic factors are related to this disorder
inheritance,is taskspecific focal dystonia inherited ,most cases of taskspecific focal dystonia are sporadic which means they occur in people with no history of the condition in their family however at least  percent of affected individuals have a family history of focal dystonia for example writers cramp and musicians dystonia have been reported to occur in the same family the dystonia often appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance based on the observation that some affected people have a parent with the condition

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to fragile xassociated tremorataxia syndrome ,mutations in the  gene increase the risk of developing fxtas the  gene provides instructions for making a protein called fmrp which helps regulate the production of other proteins fmrp plays a role in the development of synapses which are specialized connections between nerve cells synapses are critical for relaying nerve impulses  individuals with fxtas have a mutation in which a dna segment known as a cgg triplet repeat is expanded within the  gene normally this dna segment is repeated from  to about  times in people with fxtas however the cgg segment is repeated  to  times this mutation is known as an  gene premutation an expansion of more than  repeats a full mutation causes a more serious condition called fragile x syndrome which is characterized by intellectual disability learning problems and certain physical features  for unknown reasons the premutation leads to the overproduction of abnormal  mrna that contains the expanded repeat region the  is the genetic blueprint for the production of fmrp researchers believe that the high levels of mrna cause the signs and symptoms of fxtas the mrna has been found in clumps of proteins and mrna intranuclear inclusions in brain and nerve cells in people with fxtas it is thought that attaching to  mrna and forming clumps keeps the other proteins from performing their functions although the effect of the intranuclear inclusions is unclear in addition the repeat expansion makes producing fmrp from the mrna blueprint more difficult and as a result people with the  gene premutation can have less fmrp than normal a reduction in the protein is not thought to be involved in fxtas however it may cause mild versions of the features seen in fragile x syndrome such as prominent ears anxiety and mood swings
information,what is are perry syndrome ,perry syndrome is a progressive brain disease that is characterized by four major features a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism psychiatric changes weight loss and abnormally slow breathing hypoventilation these signs and symptoms typically appear in a persons forties or fifties  parkinsonism and psychiatric changes are usually the earliest features of perry syndrome signs of parkinsonism include unusually slow movements bradykinesia stiffness and tremors these movement abnormalities are often accompanied by changes in personality and behavior the most frequent psychiatric changes that occur in people with perry syndrome include depression a general loss of interest and enthusiasm apathy withdrawal from friends and family and suicidal thoughts many affected individuals also experience significant unexplained weight loss early in the disease  hypoventilation is a later feature of perry syndrome abnormally slow breathing most often occurs at night causing affected individuals to wake up frequently as the disease worsens hypoventilation can result in a lifethreatening lack of oxygen and respiratory failure  people with perry syndrome typically survive for about  years after signs and symptoms first appear most affected individuals ultimately die of respiratory failure or pneumonia suicide is another cause of death in this condition
frequency,how many people are affected by perry syndrome ,perry syndrome is very rare about  affected individuals have been reported worldwide
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to perry syndrome ,perry syndrome results from mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein called  which is involved in the transport of materials within cells to move materials  interacts with other proteins and with a tracklike system of small tubes called microtubules these components work together like a conveyer belt to move materials within cells this transport system appears to be particularly important for the normal function and survival of nerve cells neurons in the brain  mutations in the  gene alter the structure of  making it less able to attach bind to microtubules and transport materials within cells this abnormality causes neurons to malfunction and ultimately die a gradual loss of neurons in areas of the brain that regulate movement emotion and breathing underlies the signs and symptoms of perry syndrome

information,what is are actinaccumulation myopathy ,actinaccumulation myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles which are muscles that the body uses for movement people with actinaccumulation myopathy have severe muscle weakness myopathy and poor muscle tone hypotonia throughout the body signs and symptoms of this condition are apparent in infancy and include feeding and swallowing difficulties a weak cry and difficulty with controlling head movements affected babies are sometimes described as floppy and may be unable to move on their own  the severe muscle weakness that occurs in actinaccumulation myopathy also affects the muscles used for breathing individuals with this disorder may take shallow breaths hypoventilate especially during sleep resulting in a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood frequent respiratory infections and lifethreatening breathing difficulties can occur because of the respiratory problems most affected individuals do not survive past infancy those who do survive have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting crawling standing and walking  the name actinaccumulation myopathy derives from characteristic accumulations in muscle cells of filaments composed of a protein called actin these filaments can be seen when muscle tissue is viewed under a microscope
information,what is are hirschsprung disease ,hirschsprung disease is an intestinal disorder characterized by the absence of nerves in parts of the intestine this condition occurs when the nerves in the intestine enteric nerves do not form properly during development before birth embryonic development this condition is usually identified in the first two months of life although less severe cases may be diagnosed later in childhood  enteric nerves trigger the muscle contractions that move stool through the intestine without these nerves in parts of the intestine the material cannot be pushed through causing severe constipation or complete blockage of the intestine in people with hirschsprung disease other signs and symptoms of this condition include vomiting abdominal pain or swelling diarrhea poor feeding malnutrition and slow growth people with this disorder are at risk of developing more serious conditions such as inflammation of the intestine enterocolitis or a hole in the wall of the intestine intestinal perforation which can cause serious infection and may be fatal  there are two main types of hirschsprung disease known as shortsegment disease and longsegment disease which are defined by the region of the intestine lacking nerve cells in shortsegment disease nerve cells are missing from only the last segment of the large intestine this type is most common occurring in approximately  percent of people with hirschsprung disease for unknown reasons shortsegment disease is four times more common in men than in women longsegment disease occurs when nerve cells are missing from most of the large intestine and is the more severe type longsegment disease is found in approximately  percent of people with hirschsprung disease and affects men and women equally very rarely nerve cells are missing from the entire large intestine and sometimes part of the small intestine total colonic aganglionosis or from all of the large and small intestine total intestinal aganglionosis  hirschsprung disease can occur in combination with other conditions such as waardenburg syndrome type iv mowatwilson syndrome or congenital central hypoventilation syndrome these cases are described as syndromic hirschsprung disease can also occur without other conditions and these cases are referred to as isolated or nonsyndromic
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to hirschsprung disease ,isolated hirschsprung disease can result from mutations in one of several genes including the ret ednrb and  genes however the genetics of this condition appear complex and are not completely understood while a mutation in a single gene sometimes causes the condition mutations in multiple genes may be required in some cases the genetic cause of the condition is unknown in approximately half of affected individuals  mutations in the ret gene are the most common known genetic cause of hirschsprung disease the ret gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is involved in signaling within cells this protein appears to be essential for the normal development of several kinds of nerve cells including nerves in the intestine mutations in the ret gene that cause hirschsprung disease result in a nonfunctional version of the ret protein that cannot transmit signals within cells without ret protein signaling enteric nerves do not develop properly absence of these nerves leads to the intestinal problems characteristic of hirschsprung disease  the ednrb gene provides instructions for making a protein called endothelin receptor type b when this protein interacts with other proteins called endothelins it transmits information from outside the cell to inside the cell signaling for many important cellular processes the  gene provides instructions for a protein called endothelin  one of the endothelins that interacts with endothelin receptor type b together endothelin  and endothelin receptor type b play an important role in the normal formation of enteric nerves changes in either the ednrb gene or the  gene disrupt the normal functioning of the endothelin receptor type b or the endothelin  protein preventing them from transmitting signals important for the development of enteric nerves as a result these nerves do not form normally during embryonic development a lack of enteric nerves prevents stool from being moved through the intestine leading to severe constipation and intestinal blockage
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to fragile x syndrome ,mutations in the  gene cause fragile x syndrome the  gene provides instructions for making a protein called fmrp this protein helps regulate the production of other proteins and plays a role in the development of synapses which are specialized connections between nerve cells synapses are critical for relaying nerve impulses  nearly all cases of fragile x syndrome are caused by a mutation in which a dna segment known as the cgg triplet repeat is expanded within the  gene normally this dna segment is repeated from  to about  times in people with fragile x syndrome however the cgg segment is repeated more than  times the abnormally expanded cgg segment turns off silences the  gene which prevents the gene from producing fmrp loss or a shortage deficiency of this protein disrupts nervous system functions and leads to the signs and symptoms of fragile x syndrome  males and females with  to  repeats of the cgg segment are said to have an  gene premutation most people with a premutation are intellectually normal in some cases however individuals with a premutation have lower than normal amounts of fmrp as a result they may have mild versions of the physical features seen in fragile x syndrome such as prominent ears and may experience emotional problems such as anxiety or depression some children with a premutation may have learning disabilities or autisticlike behavior the premutation is also associated with an increased risk of disorders called fragile xassociated primary ovarian insufficiency fxpoi and fragile xassociated tremorataxia syndrome fxtas

inheritance,is chordoma inherited ,when development of a chordoma is associated with a duplication of the t gene inherited from a parent one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of the disorder which is an inheritance pattern called autosomal dominant people with this duplication inherit an increased risk of this condition not the condition itself  other cases of chordoma are sporadic which means they occur in people with no history of the condition in their family
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to juvenile paget disease ,juvenile paget disease is caused by mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in bone remodeling a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it  bones are constantly being remodeled and the process is carefully controlled to ensure that bones stay strong and healthy mutations in the  gene lead to a much faster rate of bone remodeling starting early in life bone tissue is broken down more quickly than usual and when new bone tissue grows it is larger weaker and less organized than normal bone this abnormally fast bone remodeling underlies the problems with bone growth characteristic of juvenile paget disease
inheritance,is juvenile paget disease inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition
information,what is are adamsoliver syndrome ,adamsoliver syndrome is a rare condition that is present at birth the primary features are an abnormality in skin development called aplasia cutis congenita and malformations of the limbs a variety of other features can occur in people with adamsoliver syndrome  most people with adamsoliver syndrome have aplasia cutis congenita a condition characterized by localized areas of missing skin typically occurring on the top of the head the skull vertex in some cases the bone under the skin is also underdeveloped individuals with this condition commonly have scarring and an absence of hair growth in the affected area  abnormalities of the hands and feet are also common in people with adamsoliver syndrome these most often involve the fingers and toes and can include abnormal nails fingers or toes that are fused together syndactyly and abnormally short or missing fingers or toes brachydactyly or oligodactyly in some cases other bones in the hands feet or lower limbs are malformed or missing  some affected infants have a condition called cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita this disorder of the blood vessels causes a reddish or purplish netlike pattern on the skin in addition people with adamsoliver syndrome can develop high blood pressure in the blood vessels between the heart and the lungs pulmonary hypertension which can be lifethreatening other blood vessel problems and heart defects can occur in affected individuals  in some cases people with adamsoliver syndrome have neurological problems such as developmental delay learning disabilities or abnormalities in the structure of the brain

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to acatalasemia ,mutations in the cat gene can cause acatalasemia this gene provides instructions for making the enzyme catalase which breaks down hydrogen peroxide molecules into oxygen and water hydrogen peroxide is produced through chemical reactions within cells at low levels it is involved in several chemical signaling pathways but at high levels it is toxic to cells if hydrogen peroxide is not broken down by catalase additional reactions convert it into compounds called reactive oxygen species that can damage dna proteins and cell membranes  mutations in the cat gene greatly reduce the activity of catalase a shortage of this enzyme can allow hydrogen peroxide to build up to toxic levels in certain cells for example hydrogen peroxide produced by bacteria in the mouth may accumulate in and damage soft tissues leading to mouth ulcers and gangrene a buildup of hydrogen peroxide may also damage beta cells of the pancreas which release a hormone called insulin that helps control blood sugar malfunctioning beta cells are thought to underlie the increased risk of type  diabetes mellitus in people with acatalasemia it is unclear why some people have no health problems associated with a loss of catalase activity  many people with reduced catalase activity do not have an identified mutation in the cat gene in these cases the cause of the condition is unknown researchers believe that other genetic and environmental factors can also influence the activity of catalase
inheritance,is acatalasemia inherited ,acatalasemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance which means both copies of the cat gene in each cell have mutations when both copies of the gene are altered the activity of catalase is reduced to less than  percent of normal  when only one of the two copies of the cat gene has a mutation the activity of catalase is reduced by approximately half this reduction in catalase activity is often called hypocatalasemia like acatalasemia hypocatalasemia usually does not cause any health problems

information,what is are citrullinemia ,citrullinemia is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia and other toxic substances to accumulate in the blood two forms of citrullinemia have been described they have different signs and symptoms and are caused by mutations in different genes  type i citrullinemia also known as classic citrullinemia usually becomes evident in the first few days of life affected infants typically appear normal at birth but as ammonia builds up in the body they experience a progressive lack of energy lethargy poor feeding vomiting seizures and loss of consciousness these medical problems are lifethreatening in many cases less commonly a milder form of type i citrullinemia can develop later in childhood or adulthood this lateronset form is associated with intense headaches partial loss of vision problems with balance and muscle coordination ataxia and lethargy some people with gene mutations that cause type i citrullinemia never experience signs and symptoms of the disorder  type ii citrullinemia chiefly affects the nervous system causing confusion restlessness memory loss abnormal behaviors such as aggression irritability and hyperactivity seizures and coma in some cases the signs and symptoms of this disorder appear during adulthood adultonset these signs and symptoms can be lifethreatening and are known to be triggered by certain medications infections surgery and alcohol intake in people with adultonset type ii citrullinemia  the features of adultonset type ii citrullinemia may also develop in people who as infants had a liver disorder called neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency niccd this liver condition is also known as neonatalonset type ii citrullinemia niccd blocks the flow of bile a digestive fluid produced by the liver and prevents the body from processing certain nutrients properly in many cases the signs and symptoms of niccd resolve within a year years or even decades later however some of these people develop the characteristic features of adultonset type ii citrullinemia
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to citrullinemia ,mutations in the  and  genes cause citrullinemia  citrullinemia belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders the urea cycle is a sequence of chemical reactions that takes place in liver cells these reactions process excess nitrogen that is generated when protein is used by the body the excess nitrogen is used to make a compound called urea which is excreted in urine  mutations in the  gene cause type i citrullinemia this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme argininosuccinate synthase  that is responsible for one step of the urea cycle mutations in the  gene reduce the activity of the enzyme which disrupts the urea cycle and prevents the body from processing nitrogen effectively excess nitrogen in the form of ammonia and other byproducts of the urea cycle accumulate in the bloodstream ammonia is particularly toxic to the nervous system which helps explain the neurologic symptoms such as lethargy seizures and ataxia that are often seen in type i citrullinemia  mutations in the  gene are responsible for adultonset type ii citrullinemia and niccd this gene provides instructions for making a protein called citrin within cells citrin helps transport molecules used in the production and breakdown of simple sugars the production of proteins and the urea cycle molecules transported by citrin are also involved in making nucleotides which are the building blocks of dna and its chemical cousin rna mutations in the  gene typically prevent cells from making any functional citrin which inhibits the urea cycle and disrupts the production of proteins and nucleotides the resulting buildup of ammonia and other toxic substances leads to the signs and symptoms of adultonset type ii citrullinemia a lack of citrin also leads to the features of niccd although ammonia does not build up in the bloodstream of infants with this condition

information,what is are androgenetic alopecia ,androgenetic alopecia is a common form of hair loss in both men and women in men this condition is also known as malepattern baldness hair is lost in a welldefined pattern beginning above both temples over time the hairline recedes to form a characteristic m shape hair also thins at the crown near the top of the head often progressing to partial or complete baldness  the pattern of hair loss in women differs from malepattern baldness in women the hair becomes thinner all over the head and the hairline does not recede androgenetic alopecia in women rarely leads to total baldness  androgenetic alopecia in men has been associated with several other medical conditions including coronary heart disease and enlargement of the prostate additionally prostate cancer disorders of insulin resistance such as diabetes and obesity and high blood pressure hypertension have been related to androgenetic alopecia in women this form of hair loss is associated with an increased risk of polycystic ovary syndrome pcos pcos is characterized by a hormonal imbalance that can lead to irregular menstruation acne excess hair elsewhere on the body hirsutism and weight gain
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to androgenetic alopecia ,a variety of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing androgenetic alopecia although researchers are studying risk factors that may contribute to this condition most of these factors remain unknown researchers have determined that this form of hair loss is related to hormones called androgens particularly an androgen called dihydrotestosterone androgens are important for normal male sexual development before birth and during puberty androgens also have other important functions in both males and females such as regulating hair growth and sex drive  hair growth begins under the skin in structures called follicles each strand of hair normally grows for  to  years goes into a resting phase for several months and then falls out the cycle starts over when the follicle begins growing a new hair increased levels of androgens in hair follicles can lead to a shorter cycle of hair growth and the growth of shorter and thinner strands of hair additionally there is a delay in the growth of new hair to replace strands that are shed  although researchers suspect that several genes play a role in androgenetic alopecia variations in only one gene ar have been confirmed in scientific studies the ar gene provides instructions for making a protein called an androgen receptor androgen receptors allow the body to respond appropriately to dihydrotestosterone and other androgens studies suggest that variations in the ar gene lead to increased activity of androgen receptors in hair follicles it remains unclear however how these genetic changes increase the risk of hair loss in men and women with androgenetic alopecia  researchers continue to investigate the connection between androgenetic alopecia and other medical conditions such as coronary heart disease and prostate cancer in men and polycystic ovary syndrome in women they believe that some of these disorders may be associated with elevated androgen levels which may help explain why they tend to occur with androgenrelated hair loss other hormonal environmental and genetic factors that have not been identified also may be involved
information,what is are adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ,adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine that appears in late childhood or adolescence instead of growing straight the spine develops a sidetoside curvature usually in an elongated s or c shape the bones of the spine are also slightly twisted or rotated  adolescent idiopathic scoliosis appears during the adolescent growth spurt a time when children are growing rapidly in many cases the abnormal spinal curve is stable although in some children the curve is progressive meaning it becomes more severe over time for unknown reasons severe and progressive curves occur more frequently in girls than in boys however mild spinal curvature is equally common in girls and boys  mild scoliosis generally does not cause pain problems with movement or difficulty breathing it may only be diagnosed if it is noticed during a regular physical examination or a scoliosis screening at school the most common signs of the condition include a tilt or unevenness asymmetry in the shoulders hips or waist or having one leg that appears longer than the other a small percentage of affected children develop more severe pronounced spinal curvature  scoliosis can occur as a feature of other conditions including a variety of genetic syndromes however adolescent idiopathic scoliosis typically occurs by itself without signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body

information,what is are hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia ,hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia is an inherited condition caused by the bodys inability to absorb and retain magnesium that is taken in through the diet as a result magnesium levels in the blood are severely low hypomagnesemia  hypomagnesemia impairs the function of the parathyroid glands which are small hormoneproducing glands located in the neck normally the parathyroid glands release a hormone that increases blood calcium levels when they are low magnesium is required for the production and release of parathyroid hormone so when magnesium is too low insufficient parathyroid hormone is produced and blood calcium levels are also reduced hypocalcemia the hypocalcemia is described as secondary because it occurs as a consequence of hypomagnesemia  shortages of magnesium and calcium can cause neurological problems that begin in infancy including painful muscle spasms tetany and seizures if left untreated hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia can lead to developmental delay intellectual disability a failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate failure to thrive and heart failure
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia ,hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia is caused by mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a channel which allows charged atoms ions of magnesium  to flow into cells the channel may also allow small amounts of calcium ions  to pass into cells magnesium is involved in many cell processes including production of cellular energy maintenance of dna building blocks nucleotides protein production and cell growth and death magnesium and calcium are also required for the normal functioning of nerve cells that control muscle movement motor neurons  the  channel is embedded in the membrane of epithelial cells that line the large intestine structures in the kidneys known as distal convoluted tubules the lungs and the testes in males when the body needs additional  the  channel allows it to be absorbed in the intestine and filtered from the fluids that pass through the kidneys by the distal convoluted tubules when the body has sufficient or too much  the  channel does not filter out the  from fluids but allows the ion to be released from the kidney cells into the urine the channel also helps to regulate  but to a lesser degree  most  gene mutations that cause hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia result in a lack of functional protein a loss of functional  channels prevent  absorption in the intestine and cause excessive amounts of  to be excreted by the kidneys and released in the urine a lack of  in the body impairs the production of parathyroid hormone which likely reduces blood  levels additionally hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia can disrupt many cell processes and impair the function of motor neurons leading to neurological problems and movement disorders if the condition is not effectively treated and low  levels persist signs and symptoms can worsen over time and may lead to early death
inheritance,is hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition
information,what is are inherited thyroxinebinding globulin deficiency ,inherited thyroxinebinding globulin deficiency is a genetic condition that typically does not cause any health problems  thyroxinebinding globulin is a protein that carries hormones made or used by the thyroid gland which is a butterflyshaped tissue in the lower neck thyroid hormones play an important role in regulating growth brain development and the rate of chemical reactions in the body metabolism most of the time these hormones circulate in the bloodstream attached to thyroxinebinding globulin and similar proteins if there is a shortage deficiency of thyroxinebinding globulin the amount of circulating thyroid hormones is reduced  researchers have identified two forms of inherited thyroxinebinding globulin deficiency the complete form tbgcd which results in a total loss of thyroxinebinding globulin and the partial form tbgpd which reduces the amount of this protein or alters its structure neither of these conditions causes any problems with thyroid function they are usually identified during routine blood tests that measure thyroid hormones  although inherited thyroxinebinding globulin deficiency does not cause any health problems it can be mistaken for more serious thyroid disorders such as hypothyroidism therefore it is important to diagnose inherited thyroxinebinding globulin deficiency to avoid unnecessary treatments

information,what is are cap myopathy ,cap myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles which are muscles that the body uses for movement people with cap myopathy have muscle weakness myopathy and poor muscle tone hypotonia throughout the body but they are most severely affected in the muscles of the face neck and limbs the muscle weakness which begins at birth or during childhood can worsen over time  affected individuals may have feeding and swallowing difficulties in infancy they typically have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting crawling standing and walking they may fall frequently tire easily and have difficulty running climbing stairs or jumping in some cases the muscles used for breathing are affected and lifethreatening breathing difficulties can occur  people with cap myopathy may have a high arch in the roof of the mouth higharched palate severely drooping eyelids ptosis and a long face some affected individuals develop an abnormally curved lower back lordosis or a spine that curves to the side scoliosis  the name cap myopathy comes from characteristic abnormal caplike structures that can be seen in muscle cells when muscle tissue is viewed under a microscope the severity of cap myopathy is related to the percentage of muscle cells that have these caps individuals in whom  to  percent of muscle cells have caps typically have severe breathing problems and may not survive childhood while those in whom  to  percent of muscle cells have caps have milder symptoms and can live into adulthood
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to cap myopathy ,mutations in the   or  genes can cause cap myopathy these genes provide instructions for producing proteins that play important roles in skeletal muscles  the  gene provides instructions for making a protein called skeletal alpha actin which is part of the actin protein family actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing of muscle fibers muscle contraction thin filaments made up of actin molecules and thick filaments made up of another protein called myosin are the primary components of muscle fibers and are important for muscle contraction attachment binding and release of the overlapping thick and thin filaments allows them to move relative to each other so that the muscles can contract the mutation in the  gene that causes cap myopathy results in an abnormal protein that may interfere with the proper assembly of thin filaments the cap structures in muscle cells characteristic of this disorder are composed of disorganized thin filaments  the  and  genes provide instructions for making proteins that are members of the tropomyosin protein family tropomyosin proteins regulate muscle contraction by attaching to actin and controlling its binding to myosin the specific effects of  and  gene mutations are unclear but researchers suggest they may interfere with normal actinmyosin binding between the thin and thick filaments impairing muscle contraction and resulting in the muscle weakness that occurs in cap myopathy
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to donnaibarrow syndrome ,mutations in the  gene cause donnaibarrow syndrome the  gene provides instructions for making a protein called megalin which functions as a receptor receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins called ligands fit like keys into locks together ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function megalin has many ligands involved in various body processes including the absorption of vitamins a and d immune functioning stress response and the transport of fats in the bloodstream  megalin is embedded in the membrane of cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body epithelial cells the receptor helps move its ligands from the cell surface into the cell endocytosis it is active in the development and function of many parts of the body including the brain and spinal cord central nervous system eyes ears lungs intestine reproductive system and the small tubes in the kidneys where urine is formed renal tubules   gene mutations that cause donnaibarrow syndrome are believed to result in the absence of functional megalin protein the lack of functional megalin in the renal tubules causes megalins various ligands to be excreted in the urine rather than being absorbed back into the bloodstream the features of donnaibarrow syndrome are probably caused by the inability of megalin to help absorb these ligands disruption of biochemical signaling pathways or other effects of the nonfunctional megalin protein however it is unclear how these abnormalities result in the specific signs and symptoms of the disorder  a condition previously classified as a separate disorder called faciooculoacousticorenal foar syndrome has also been found to be caused by  mutations foar syndrome is now considered to be the same disorder as donnaibarrow syndrome
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to renal coloboma syndrome ,renal coloboma syndrome is caused by mutations in the  gene the  gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the early development of the eyes ears brain and spinal cord central nervous system kidneys and genital tract the  protein attaches binds to specific regions of dna and regulates the activity of other genes on the basis of this role the  protein is called a transcription factor after birth the  protein is thought to protect against cell death during periods of cellular stress  mutations in the  gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional  protein that is unable to aid in development causing incomplete formation of certain tissues why the kidneys and eyes are specifically affected by  gene mutations is unclear  approximately half of those affected with renal coloboma syndrome do not have an identified mutation in the  gene in these cases the cause of the disorder is unknown

information,what is are  nonsyndromic male infertility , nonsyndromic male infertility is a condition that affects the function of sperm leading to an inability to father children males with this condition produce sperm that have decreased movement motility affected men may also produce a smaller than usual number of sperm cells or sperm cells that are abnormally shaped men with  nonsyndromic male infertility do not have any other symptoms related to this condition
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to  nonsyndromic male infertility ,mutations in the  gene cause  nonsyndromic male infertility the  gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is found in the tail of sperm cells the  protein is involved in the movement of the sperm tail which propels the sperm forward and is required for sperm cells to push through the outside membrane of the egg cell during fertilization   gene mutations result in the production of a  protein that may be altered nonfunctional or quickly broken down degraded by the cell sperm cells missing a functional  protein have decreased motion in their tails and move more slowly than normal sperm cells lacking functional  protein cannot push through the outside membrane of the egg cell as a result sperm cells cannot reach the inside of the egg cell to achieve fertilization
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to aicardigoutieres syndrome ,mutations in the     and  genes have been identified in people with aicardigoutieres syndrome  the    and  genes provide instructions for making nucleases which are enzymes that help break up molecules of dna and its chemical cousin rna mutations in any of these genes are believed to result in an absent or dysfunctional nuclease enzyme researchers suggest that absent or impaired enzyme function may result in the accumulation of unneeded dna and rna in cells these dna and rna molecules or fragments may be generated during the first stage of protein production transcription copying replication of cells genetic material in preparation for cell division dna repair cell death and other processes the unneeded dna and rna may be mistaken by cells for that of viral invaders triggering immune system reactions that result in encephalopathy skin lesions and other signs and symptoms of aicardigoutieres syndrome  the  gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood however it is believed to be involved in the immune system and the inflammatory process mutations in this gene likely result in a protein that does not function properly resulting in immune system abnormalities inflammatory damage to the brain and skin and other characteristics of aicardigoutieres syndrome
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to microcephalycapillary malformation syndrome ,microcephalycapillary malformation syndrome results from mutations in the stambp gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein called stam binding protein this protein plays a role in sorting damaged or unneeded proteins so they can be transported from the cell surface to specialized cell compartments that break down degrade or recycle them this process helps to maintain the proper balance of protein production and breakdown protein homeostasis that cells need to function and survive studies suggest that stam binding protein is also involved in multiple chemical signaling pathways within cells including pathways needed for overall growth and the formation of new blood vessels angiogenesis  mutations in the stambp gene reduce or eliminate the production of stam binding protein this shortage allows damaged or unneeded proteins to build up inside cells instead of being degraded or recycled which may damage cells and cause them to selfdestruct undergo apoptosis researchers suspect that abnormal apoptosis of brain cells starting before birth may cause microcephaly and the underlying brain abnormalities found in people with microcephalycapillary malformation syndrome a lack of stam binding protein also alters multiple signaling pathways that are necessary for normal development which may underlie the capillary malformations and other signs and symptoms of the condition

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to renpenning syndrome ,renpenning syndrome is caused by mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein called polyglutaminebinding protein  this protein attaches binds to stretches of multiple copies of a protein building block amino acid called glutamine in certain other proteins  while the specific function of polyglutaminebinding protein  is not well understood it is believed to play a role in processing and transporting rna a chemical cousin of dna that serves as the genetic blueprint for the production of proteins  in nerve cells neurons such as those in the brain polyglutaminebinding protein  is found in structures called rna granules these granules allow the transport and storage of rna within the cell the rna is held within the granules until the genetic information it carries is translated to produce proteins or until cellular signals or environmental factors trigger the rna to be degraded through these mechanisms polyglutaminebinding protein  is thought to help control the way genetic information is used gene expression in neurons this control is important for normal brain development  most of the mutations in the  gene that cause renpenning syndrome result in an abnormally short polyglutaminebinding protein  the function of a shortened or otherwise abnormal protein is likely impaired and interferes with normal gene expression in neurons resulting in abnormal development of the brain and the signs and symptoms of renpenning syndrome

inheritance,is asperger syndrome inherited ,autism spectrum disorders including asperger syndrome have a tendency to run in families but the inheritance pattern is unknown
inheritance,is leggcalvperthes disease inherited ,when associated with  gene mutations the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means one copy of the altered  gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder  most  cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family these cases are referred to as sporadic in other cases the condition is passed through families in these cases referred to as familial an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent
information,what is are beckwithwiedemann syndrome ,beckwithwiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body it is classified as an overgrowth syndrome which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal macrosomia and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood growth begins to slow by about age  and adults with this condition are not unusually tall in some children with beckwithwiedemann syndrome specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance this unusual growth pattern which is known as hemihyperplasia usually becomes less apparent over time  the signs and symptoms of beckwithwiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen an omphalocele that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the bellybutton other abdominal wall defects such as a soft outpouching around the bellybutton an umbilical hernia are also common some infants with beckwithwiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue macroglossia which may interfere with breathing swallowing and speaking other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs visceromegaly creases or pits in the skin near the ears low blood sugar hypoglycemia in infancy and kidney abnormalities  children with beckwithwiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors particularly a form of kidney cancer called wilms tumor and a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma tumors develop in about  percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood  most children and adults with beckwithwiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition their life expectancy is usually normal
information,what is are costello syndrome ,costello syndrome is a disorder that affects many parts of the body this condition is characterized by delayed development and intellectual disability loose folds of skin which are especially noticeable on the hands and feet unusually flexible joints and distinctive facial features including a large mouth heart problems are common including an abnormal heartbeat arrhythmia structural heart defects and a type of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart muscle hypertrophic cardiomyopathy infants with costello syndrome may be larger than average at birth but most have difficulty feeding and grow more slowly than other children people with this condition have relatively short stature and may have reduced growth hormone levels other signs and symptoms of costello syndrome can include tight achilles tendons which connect the calf muscles to the heel weak muscle tone hypotonia a structural abnormality of the brain called a chiari i malformation skeletal abnormalities dental problems and problems with vision  beginning in early childhood people with costello syndrome are at an increased risk of developing certain cancerous and noncancerous tumors the most common noncancerous tumors associated with this condition are papillomas which are small wartlike growths that usually develop around the nose and mouth or near the anus the most common cancerous tumor associated with costello syndrome is a childhood cancer called rhabdomyosarcoma which begins in muscle tissue neuroblastoma a tumor that arises in developing nerve cells also has been reported in children and adolescents with this syndrome in addition some teenagers with costello syndrome have developed transitional cell carcinoma a form of bladder cancer that is usually seen in older adults  the signs and symptoms of costello syndrome overlap significantly with those of two other genetic conditions cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome cfc syndrome and noonan syndrome in affected infants it can be difficult to tell the three conditions apart based on their physical features however the conditions can be distinguished by their genetic cause and by specific patterns of signs and symptoms that develop later in childhood
inheritance,is costello syndrome inherited ,costello syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder almost all reported cases have resulted from new gene mutations and have occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family
information,what is are laing distal myopathy ,laing distal myopathy is a condition that affects skeletal muscles which are muscles that the body uses for movement this disorder causes progressive muscle weakness that appears in childhood the first sign of laing distal myopathy is usually weakness in certain muscles in the feet and ankles this weakness leads to tightening of the achilles tendon the band that connects the heel of the foot to the calf muscles an inability to lift the first big toe and a highstepping walk months to years later muscle weakness develops in the hands and wrists weakness in these muscles makes it difficult to lift the fingers particularly the third and fourth fingers many affected people also experience hand tremors  in addition to muscle weakness in the hands and feet laing distal myopathy causes weakness in several muscles of the neck and face a decade or more after the onset of symptoms mild weakness also spreads to muscles in the legs hips and shoulders laing distal myopathy progresses very gradually and most affected people remain mobile throughout life life expectancy is normal in people with this condition
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to laing distal myopathy ,mutations in the  gene cause laing distal myopathy the  gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in heart cardiac muscle and in type i skeletal muscle fibers type i fibers which are also known as slowtwitch fibers are one of two types of fibers that make up skeletal muscles type i fibers are the primary component of skeletal muscles that are resistant to fatigue for example muscles involved in posture such as the neck muscles that hold the head steady are made predominantly of type i fibers  in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells the protein produced from the  gene forms part of a larger protein called type ii myosin this type of myosin generates the mechanical force that is needed for muscles to contract in the heart regular contractions of cardiac muscle pump blood to the rest of the body the coordinated contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscles allow the body to move  it is unknown how mutations in the  gene cause progressive muscle weakness in people with laing distal myopathy researchers have proposed that these mutations alter the structure of myosin in skeletal muscles which prevents it from interacting with other proteins the abnormal myosin gradually impairs the function of type i skeletal muscle fibers  in most people with laing distal myopathy the signs and symptoms of the disorder are limited to weakness of skeletal muscles although myosin made with the  protein is also found in cardiac muscle it is unclear why heart problems are not a typical feature of this condition
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to achondroplasia ,mutations in the  gene cause achondroplasia the  gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue two specific mutations in the  gene are responsible for almost all cases of achondroplasia researchers believe that these mutations cause the  protein to be overly active which interferes with skeletal development and leads to the disturbances in bone growth seen with this disorder
information,what is are head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ,squamous cell carcinoma is a cancer that arises from particular cells called squamous cells squamous cells are found in the outer layer of skin and in the mucous membranes which are the moist tissues that line body cavities such as the airways and intestines head and neck squamous cell carcinoma hnscc develops in the mucous membranes of the mouth nose and throat  hnscc is classified by its location it can occur in the mouth oral cavity the middle part of the throat near the mouth oropharynx the space behind the nose nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses the upper part of the throat near the nasal cavity nasopharynx the voicebox larynx or the lower part of the throat near the larynx hypopharynx depending on the location the cancer can cause abnormal patches or open sores ulcers in the mouth and throat unusual bleeding or pain in the mouth sinus congestion that does not clear sore throat earache pain when swallowing or difficulty swallowing a hoarse voice difficulty breathing or enlarged lymph nodes  hnscc can spread metastasize to other parts of the body such as the lymph nodes or lungs if it spreads the cancer has a worse prognosis and can be fatal about half of affected individuals survive more than five years after diagnosis
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ,hnscc is caused by a variety of factors that can alter the dna in cells the strongest risk factors for developing this form of cancer are tobacco use including smoking or using chewing tobacco and heavy alcohol consumption in addition studies have shown that infection with certain strains of human papillomavirus hpv is linked to the development of hnscc hpv infection accounts for the increasing incidence of hnscc in younger people  researchers have identified mutations in many genes in people with hnscc however it is not yet clear what role most of these mutations play in the development or progression of cancer the proteins produced from several of the genes associated with hnscc including   and  function as tumor suppressors which means they normally keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way when tumor suppressors are impaired cells can grow and divide without control leading to tumor formation it is likely that a series of changes in multiple genes is involved in the development and progression of hnscc
inheritance,is lowe syndrome inherited ,this condition is inherited in an xlinked pattern a condition is considered xlinked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome one of the two sex chromosomes in males who have only one x chromosome one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition in females who have two x chromosomes a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder most xlinked disorders affect males much more frequently than females a characteristic of xlinked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass xlinked traits to their sons  in some cases of lowe syndrome an affected male inherits the mutation from a mother who carries one altered copy of the ocrl gene other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in males with no history of the disorder in their family  females who carry one mutated copy of the ocrl gene do not have the characteristic features of lowe syndrome most female carriers however have changes in the lens of the eye that can be observed with a thorough eye examination these changes typically do not impair vision

inheritance,is glucose transporter type  deficiency syndrome inherited ,is glucose transporter type  deficiency syndrome inherited glucose transporter type  deficiency syndrome  deficiency syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner this means that to be affected a person only needs a change mutation in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell in some cases an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent other cases may result from new de novo mutations in the gene these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family a person with  deficiency syndrome has a  chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child
causes,what causes cleidocranial dysplasia ,what causes cleidocranial dysplasia cleidocranial dysplasia is caused by mutations in the   gene the  gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in bone and cartilage development and maintenance researchers believe that the  protein acts as a master switch regulating a number of other genes involved in the development of cells that build bones osteoblasts some mutations change one protein building block amino acid in the  protein other mutations result in an abnormally short protein this shortage of functional  protein interferes with normal bone and cartilage development resulting in the signs and symptoms of cleidocranial dysplasia in rare cases affected individuals may experience additional unusual symptoms resulting from the loss of other genes located near  in about onethird of individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia no mutation in the  gene has been found the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown read more about the  gene
inheritance,is xlinked hypophosphatemia inherited ,how is xlinked hypophosphatemia inherited xlinked hypophosphatemia xlh is caused by mutations in the phex gene and is inherited in an xlinked dominant manner this means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the x chromosome and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition in both males and females a female with xlh has a  chance of passing along a mutation to each of her children since males only have one xchromosome a male with xlh will pass along the condition to all of his daughters but not to his sons phex mutations are inherited through families but they can also occur spontaneously explaining why some people with xlh may not have a previous family history
exams and tests,how to diagnose xlinked hypophosphatemia ,how is xlinked hypophosphatemia diagnosed xlinked hypophosphatemia xlh is diagnosed based on clinical observations biochemical testing imaging and family history observable signs include low growth rate and noticeable bowing of the legs xrays provide more information that can rule out other potential causes for these symptoms biochemical findings include low concentrations of phosphate in the blood accompanied by unexpectedly normal levels of vitamin dand calcium elevated levels of  and phosphate excretion can also be measured genetic testing is also available but is not required to make a diagnosis is genetic testing available for xlinked hypophosphatemia xlinked hypophosphatemia is generally diagnosed based upon clinical findings genetic testing is available to confirm a suspected diagnosis but is not required available methods include single gene sequencing and deletionduplication analysis of the phex gene however these tests are not able to detect a causal genetic change in all people affected with xlh panel testing is also available that looks for variants in a number of genes associated with other types of hypophosphatemic rickets

treatment,what are the treatments for febrile ulceronecrotic muchahabermann disease ,how is febrile ulceronecrotic muchahabermann disease fumhd treated it is important that fumhd is diagnosed and treated as soon as possible while a number of treatments have been tried it is hard to asses the benefit of the therapies because there are so few cases of fumhd and among reported cases the treatment approach may vary the case reports describe treatment with systemic steroids methotrexate antibiotics dapsone cyclosporine psoralen and ultraviolet a puva ultraviolet b uvb unspecified ultraviolet receptor acyclovir immunoglobulins and  dds again the efficacy of these therapies are not known  acyclovir was prescribed in cases where varicella was initially suspected none of these cases turned out to be associated with herpes simplex or varicellazoster virus infection the benefit of acyclovir therapy in people with fumhd is questionable systemic steroids have been commonly utilized among reported cases  of  cases with only one report of a positive effect methotrexate has been used in  patients it induced rapid remissions and was successful in cases that did not respond to other therapies still four patients died despite methotrexate theapy it is possible this was due to its late institution debridement and skin grafting was successful in one case but the patient was left with considerable scaring in advanced disease therapy is also aimed at stabilizing the patient intensive care treatment of infection and maintenance of the patients general condition is vital the state of these patients is similar to what is seen in patients with severe burns thus patients with fumhd may benefit from the same supportive services that burn victims receive treatment with tumor necrosis factor tnfalpha inhibitors such as infliximab and etanercept has been suggested as a firstline option in the management of fumhd because elevated levels of serum tnfalpha have been reported in this disease however further studies may be required to establish this approach to treatment more detailed information about treatment options for fumhd can be accessed through the dermnet nz web site
causes,what causes klippel feil syndrome ,what causes klippel feil syndrome kfs  the specific underlying causes and mechanisms of klippel feil syndrome kfsare not well understood  in general medical researchers believe kfs happens when the tissue of the embroyo that normally develops into separate vertebrae does not divide correctly  more specifically when kfs occurs with other syndromes such as fetal alcohol syndrome goldenhar syndrome wildervanck syndrome or hemifacial microsomia medical researchers believe kfs has the same cause as the associated syndrome  isolated kfs meaning not associated with another syndrome can be sporadic or inherited  although kfs may in some cases be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors mutations in at least three genes have been linked to kfs   and  gene
inheritance,is klippel feil syndrome inherited ,is klippel feil syndrome inherited in some cases klippel feil syndrome kfs appears to occur randomly for unknown reasons sporadically in other cases the condition appears to be genetic and may occur in more than one person in a family both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns have been reported with different responsible genes when kfs is caused by changes mutations in the  or  genes it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner this means that having a mutation in only one copy of the responsible gene is enough to cause features of the condition when a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children each child has a   in  chance to inherit the mutated copy of the gene when kfs is caused by mutations in the  gene it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner this means that a person must have mutations in both copies of the responsible gene to be affected the parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers carriers are typically unaffected when two carriers of the same autosomal recessive condition have children each child has a   in  risk to be affected a   in  chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent and a  risk to be unaffected and not be a carrier when kfs occurs as a feature of another condition the inheritance pattern follows that of the other condition

exams and tests,how to diagnose creutzfeldtjakob disease ,how is creutzfeldtjakob disease diagnosed there is currently no single diagnostic test for creutzfeldtjakob disease cjd when a doctor suspects cjd the first concern is to rule out treatable forms of dementia such as encephalitis inflammation of the brain or chronic meningitis a neurological examination will be performed and the doctor may seek consultation with other physicians standard diagnostic tests will include a spinal tap to rule out more common causes of dementia and an electroencephalogram eeg to record the brains electrical pattern which can be particularly valuable because it shows a specific type of abnormality in cjd computerized tomography of the brain can help rule out the possibility that the symptoms result from other problems such as stroke or a brain tumor magnetic resonance imaging mri brain scans also can reveal characteristic patterns of brain degeneration that can help diagnose cjd the only way to confirm a diagnosis of cjd is by brain biopsy or autopsy in a brain biopsy a neurosurgeon removes a small piece of tissue from the patients brain so that it can be examined by a neuropathologist this procedure may be dangerous for the patient and the operation does not always obtain tissue from the affected part of the brain because a correct diagnosis of cjd does not help the patient a brain biopsy is discouraged unless it is needed to rule out a treatable disorder in an autopsy the whole brain is examined after death scientists are working to develop laboratory tests for cjd one such test developed at the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke ninds at the national institutes of health nih studies a persons cerebrospinal fluid to see of it contains a protein marker that indicates neuronal degenerationthis can help to diagnose cjd in people who already show the clinical symptoms of the disease this test is much easier and safer than a brain biopsy the false positive rate is about  to  percent scientists are working to develop this test for use in commercial laboratories they are also working to develop other tests for this disorder
inheritance,is chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia inherited ,is chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia inherited chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia cpeo can be inherited or it can occur sporadically due to a new mutation in an individual with no history of the condition in the family cpeo is considered a mitochondrial disorder this is because all the genetic mutations that can cause cpeo ultimately result in dysfunction of the mitochondria which are structures in our cells that produce energy required for normal cell function while most of our dna is located in the cells center nuclear dna some of our dna is located within the mitochondria mitochondrial dna cpeo can be caused by mutations in any of several genes which may be located in mitochondrial dna or nuclear dna it has different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved in the affected individual unlike nuclear dna which is inherited from both the mother and the father mitochondrial dna is inherited from only the mother in cpeo the affected mitochondria ie the ones carrying the mutations are found only in the skeletal muscle cells these mitochondrial dna mutations are almost always sporadic occurring by chance for the first time in the affected individual nuclear gene mutations that cause cpeo may be inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner depending on the gene involved the risk for other family members to be affected depends on the genetic cause and the inheritance pattern in the family

causes,what causes renal oncocytoma ,what causes a renal oncocytoma the exact underlying cause of most renal oncocytomas is unknown however researchers suspect that acquired not present at birth changes in mitochondrial dna may play a role in the development of some of these tumors renal oncocytomas sometimes occur in people with certain genetic syndromes such as tuberous sclerosis complex and birthoggdube syndrome in these cases affected people often have multiple and bilateral affecting both kidneys oncocytomas and may also have family members with these tumors when renal oncocytomas are part of a genetic syndrome they are caused by changes mutations in a specific gene tuberous sclerosis complex is caused by mutations in the  gene or  gene while birthoggdube syndrome is caused by mutations in the flcn gene
exams and tests,how to diagnose renal oncocytoma ,how is renal oncocytoma diagnosed a diagnosis of renal oncocytoma is often suspected based on imaging studies such as computed tomography ct scan andor magnetic resonance imaging mri scan however it can be difficult to differentiate a renal oncocytoma from renal cell carcinoma based on imaging studies alone although researchers are currently studying several new techniques for the diagnosis of renal oncocytoma a biopsy and surgery are typically necessary to confirm the diagnosis is genetic testing available for renal oncocytoma genetic testing is not available for many people with renal oncocytoma since most of these tumors occur sporadically by chance and are not caused by a genetic mutation however genetic testing is an option for people with an inherited condition that predisposes to renal oncocytoma such as tuberous sclerosis complex and birthoggdube syndrome carrier testing for atrisk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the diseasecausing mutation in the family is known the genetic testing registry gtr is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests it provides a list of laboratories performing genetic testing for tuberous sclerosis complex and birthoggdube syndrome the intended audience for the gtr is health care providers and researchers patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional

information,what is are immunodeficiency with hyper igm type  ,hyper igm syndrome is a type of primary immunodeficiency syndrome primary immunodeficiency occurs when part of a persons immune system is missing or does not work correctly the bodies of people with primary immunodeficiency cant get rid of germs or protect themselves from new germs as well as they should primary immunodeficiencies are inherited meaning they are passed down from parents to children hyper igm syndromes are characterized by normal or elevated serum immunoglobulin m levels with absence of immunoglobulin g a and e immunoglobulins are proteins found in the blood hyper igm results in a susceptibility to bacterial infections and sometimes opportunistic infections there are five different types of hyper igm syndromes types  the types are distinguished by the location of the gene mutation involved
causes,what causes immunodeficiency with hyper igm type  ,what causes hyper igm syndrome a flawed gene or genes in tcells a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system and helps the body fight diseases or harmful substances is responsible for hyper igm syndrome the faulty tcells do not give bcells a signal they need to switch from making igm to iga and igg most cases approximately  of hyperigm syndrome are linked to a recessive mutation on the x chromosome these cases are inherited as an xlinked recessive genetic trait because males do not have a second healthy xchromosome to offset the disease boys far out number girls with this disease a small number of cases of hyper igm syndrome have been attributed to autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant genetic inheritance in addition a rare acquired form of the disorder has been described in the medical literature

inheritance,is thalassemia inherited ,how is thalassemia inherited in general thalassemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner however the inheritance can be quite complex as multiple genes can influence the production of hemoglobin most people affected by beta thalassemia have mutations in both copies of the hbb gene in each cell the parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition although some carriers of beta thalassemia develop mild anemia when two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children each child has a   in  risk to have the condition a   in  risk to be a carrier like each of the parents and a  chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier the inheritance of alpha thalassemia is complicated by the fact that mutations in two different genes  and  are associated with the condition people have two copies of the  gene and two copies of the  gene in each cell for each gene one copy is inherited from the mother and one is inherited from the father if each parent is missing at least one gene copy their children are at risk for having alpha thalassemia however the exact risk and the severity of each childs condition depends on how many gene copies are lost deleted and which combination of the  and  genes are affected
exams and tests,how to diagnose thalassemia ,is genetic testing available for thalassemia yes genetic testing is available for hbb  and  the genes known to cause thalassemia carrier testing for atrisk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the diseasecausing mutations in the family are known the genetic testing registry gtr is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests it has additional information on genetic testing for alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia the intended audience for the gtr is health care providers and researchers patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional
treatment,what are the treatments for clear cell renal cell carcinoma ,what treatments for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma are available in north america there are several treatments for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma available in north america   and sunitinib  as well as the medications temsirolimus bevacizumab with interferon therapy pazopanib and sorafenib  are approved by the food and drug administration for the treatment of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma  because a cure for this disease has yet to be discovered the national cancer institute suggests that individuals with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma consider participation in a research study  is offered as a treatment for this disease in some individuals because it has been shown to cause a complete disappearance of signs of this disease remission in  of treated patients  as  may cause toxic side effects it is most appropriate for patients who are in excellent health  sunitinib is offered because it has been shown to stabilize metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma by stopping the disease from getting worse  individuals treated with sunitinib showed no change in their disease for an average of  months

information,what is are keratoconus ,keratoconus is the degeneration of the structure of the cornea which is the clear tissue covering the front of the eye in this condition the shape of the cornea slowly changes from the normal round shape to a cone shape most people who develop keratoconus start out nearsighted which tends to become worse over time the earliest symptom is a slight blurring of vision that cannot be corrected with glasses over time there may be eye halos glare or other night vision problemsthe cause is unknown but the tendency to develop keratoconus is probably present from birth keratoconus is thought to involve a defect in collagen the tissue that makes up most of the cornea some researchers believe that allergy and eye rubbing may play a role treatment for keratoconus depends on the severity of your condition and how quickly the condition is progressing mild to moderate keratoconus can be treated with eyeglasses or contact lenses in some people the cornea becomes scarred or wearing contact lenses becomes difficult in these cases surgery might be necessary
treatment,what are the treatments for keratoconus ,what causes keratoconus the exact cause of keratoconus is unknown both genetic and environmental factors may play a role in the development of keratoconus the genetic factors involve abnormalities in the structure of collagen which result in a weak and flexible cornea keratoconus is more common in people with down syndrome marfan syndrome and leber congenital amaurosis and certain genetic conditions in these cases the cause depends on the specific condition  environmental factors may include living in sunny hot areas of the world while eyerubbing is a major behavioral factor in the disease malfunctioning enzymes that normally help maintain the health of the cornea may play a role all of these factors contribute to the main problem in keratoconus which is the defective collagen structure that results in thinning and irregularity of the cornea keratoconus occurs more frequently in patients with atopy asthma and eczema or severe ocular allergies it may also be linked to hormonal factors because it is more frequent during puberty and also may progress during pregnancy

inheritance,is buschke ollendorff syndrome inherited ,how is buschke ollendorff syndrome inherited buschke ollendorff syndrome bos is caused by mutations in the  gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner this means that only one changed mutated copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient for a person to be affected by the condition an affected individual may have inherited a mutated copy of the  gene from an affected parent or they may have been born with a new de novo mutation there is a   in  chance for each child of an affected individual to inherit the mutated gene and a  chance for each child  to not inherit the mutated gene it has been proposed that the inheritance of bos shows incomplete penetrance penetrance refers to the proportion of people with a particular genetic change such as a mutation in a specific gene who exhibit signs and symptoms of a genetic disorder if some people with the mutation do not develop features of the disorder the condition is said to have reduced or incomplete penetrance reduced penetrance probably results from a combination of genetic environmental and lifestyle factors many of which are unknown this phenomenon can make it challenging for genetics professionals to interpret a persons family medical history and predict the risk of passing a genetic condition to future generations this means that not all individuals who have a new or inherited mutation in the  gene will necessarily develop signs and symptoms of bos

information,what is are chromosome  syndrome ,chromosome  syndrome is a rare chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located towards the end of the short arm p of chromosome  the severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the exact size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved some affected people appear to have no features or mild features while others are more severely affected common symptoms shared by many people with this deletion include poor growth developmental delay intellectual disability distinctive facial features autism spectrum disorder an unusually small head microcephaly and poor muscle tone hypotonia most cases are not inherited but people can pass the deletion on to their children treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person
information,what is are epidermolytic ichthyosis ,epidermolytic ichthyosis ei is a rare genetic skin disorder it becomes apparent at birth or shortly after birth with reddening scaling and severe blistering of the skin hyperkeratosis thickening of the skin develops within months and worsens over time blister formation decreases but may still occur after skin trauma or during summer months skin can be itchy and smelly and prone to infection other features may include reduced sweating nail abnormalities and in severe cases growth failure ei is caused by changes mutations in the  or  genes about half of cases are due to new mutations and are not inherited from a parent sporadic other cases are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and rarely in an autosomal recessive manner treatment aims at alleviating and preventing symptoms and may include topical moisturizers or medications and antiseptic washes
inheritance,is epidermolytic ichthyosis inherited ,how is epidermolytic ichthyosis inherited many cases of epidermolytic ichthyosis ei are sporadic this means they result from a new mutation in one of the responsible genes  or  in people with no family history of ei however while people with sporadic ei did not inherit the condition from a parent they may still pass the condition on to their children inherited cases of ei usually have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern this means that having a mutation in only one copy of  or  in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition when a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children each child has a   in  chance to inherit that mutation typically ei due to a new mutation will follow autosomal dominant inheritance in subsequent generations very rarely ei caused by mutations in the  gene is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner this means that to be affected a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent who is referred to as a carrier carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms they are unaffected when  carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children each child has a   in  chance to be affected   in  chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent  chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier
information,what is are fibrous dysplasia ,fibrous dysplasia is a skeletal disorder that is characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous bone tissue it may involve one bone monostotic or multiple bones polyostotic fibrous dysplasia can affect any bone in the body the most common sites are the bones in the skull and face the long bones in the arms and legs the pelvis and the ribs though many individuals with this condition do not have any symptoms others may have bone pain abnormally shaped bones or an increased risk of fractures broken bones this condition can occur alone or as part of a genetic disorder such as mccunealbright syndrome while there is no cure for fibrous dysplasia the symptoms can be treated medications known as bisphosphonates can reduce pain and surgery may be indicated for fractures or to correct misshapen bones
causes,what causes fibrous dysplasia ,what causes fibrous dysplasia the cause of fibrous dysplasia has been linked to a gene mutation that occurs after conception in the early stages of fetal development the mutation involves a gene that affects the cells that produce bone people with fibrous dysplasia carry this mutation in some but not all cells of their body it is not well understood why the mutation occurs but it is not inherited from a parent nor can it be passed on to future offspring

causes,what causes madelung disease ,what causes madelung disease the exact underlying cause of madelung disease remains unknown but several theories have been proposed the bodys inability to properly metabolize fat in affected people suggests that madelung disease may be an endocrine disorder an enzyme defect or a change in the surface of cells could prevent the breakdown of fat leading to the characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition alcohol consumption may also play a role in the development of madelung disease since roughly  of affected people have a history of alcohol abuse madelung disease has also been linked to genetic factors rarely more than one family member can be affected by this condition which suggests that it may be inherited in at least some cases in the majority of these families the mode of inheritance has not been determined however changes mutations in mitochondrial dna have been identified in some families who have madelung disease in combination with other conditions that affect many different systems of the body
treatment,what are the treatments for madelung disease ,how might madelung disease be treated to date the most effective treatment for madelung disease is surgery which may include surgical excision removal andor liposuction liposuction has gained popularity in more recent years since it results in minimal scarring it is also considered less invasive technically easier and better suited for people with a higher surgical or anaesthetic risk some researchers believe it is unnecessary to subject affected people to the risks of surgery because the condition is usually benign in their opinion surgical excision should be limited to those with airway compression or severe physical deformities the limitations of liposuction include incomplete removal of lipomas the main disadvantage of surgical excision is the scarring however it offers the chance of more extensive debulking of affected areas reportedly it is rarely possible to remove the lipomas completely and they often recur after both of these procedures some researchers have reported modest success treating the condition with the medication salbutamol which increases the breakdown of fats abstaining from alcohol intake weight loss and correction of any associated metabolicendocrine abnormalities are also recommended

inheritance,is spinocerebellar ataxia  inherited ,how is spinocerebellar ataxia  inherited spinocerebellar ataxia   is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner this means that having one changed mutated copy of  the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause signs and symptoms of the condition the  gene mutations that cause  involve a dna sequence called a cag trinucleotide repeat it is made up of a series of three dna building blocks cag stands for cytosine adenine and guanine that appear multiple times in a row the cag sequence is normally repeated about  times in the gene but it can be repeated up to  times without causing health problems  develops in people who have  or more cag repeats in the  gene in most cases an affected person inherits the mutated gene with too many repeats from an affected parent however in some cases an affected person does not have an affected parent people with an increased number of cag repeats who dont develop  are still at risk of having children who will develop the disorder this is because as the gene is passed down from parent to child the number of cag repeats often increases in general the more repeats a person has the earlier symptoms begin this phenomenon is called anticipation people with  or  repeats tend to develop symptoms in late adulthood while people with more than  repeats often have symptoms by their teens  for some reason the number of repeats tend to increase more when the gene is inherited from a persons father than when inherited from a persons mother each child of an affected person has a  chance of inheriting the cag repeat expansion
