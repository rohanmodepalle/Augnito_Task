inheritance,is doors syndrome inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition
causes,what causes cri du chat syndrome ,what causes cri du chat syndrome cri du chat syndrome is caused by a deletion of the end of the short p arm of chromosome  this chromosomal change is written as  the size of the deletion varies among affected individuals but studies suggest that larger deletions tend to result in more severe intellectual disability and developmental delay than smaller deletions the signs and symptoms of cri du chat syndrome are probably related to the loss of multiple genes on the short arm of chromosome  researchers believe that the loss of a specific gene  is associated with severe intellectual disability in some people with this condition they are working to determine how the loss of other genes in this region contributes to the characteristic features of cri du chat syndrome
symptoms,what are the symptoms of thrombocythemia and thrombocytosis ,"people who have thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis may not have signs or symptoms these conditions might be discovered only after routine blood tests
                
however people who have primary thrombocythemia are more likely than those who have secondary thrombocytosis to have serious signs and symptoms
                
the signs and symptoms of a high platelet count are linked to blood clots and bleeding they include weakness bleeding headache dizziness chest pain and tingling in the hands and feet
                
blood clots
                
in primary thrombocythemia blood clots most often develop in the brain hands and feet but they can develop anywhere in the body including in the heart and intestines
                
blood clots in the brain may cause symptoms such as chronic ongoing headache and dizziness in extreme cases stroke may occur
                
blood clots in the tiny blood vessels of the hands and feet leave them numb and red this may lead to an intense burning and throbbing pain felt mainly on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet
                
other signs and symptoms of blood clots may include
                
changes in speech or awareness ranging from confusion to passing out
                
seizures
                
upper body discomfort in one or both arms the back neck jaw or abdomen
                
shortness of breath and nausea feeling sick to your stomach
                
in pregnant women blood clots in the placenta can cause miscarriage or problems with fetal growth and development
                
women who have primary thrombocythemia or secondary thrombocytosis and take birth control pills are at increased risk for blood clots
                
blood clots are related to other conditions and factors as well older age prior blood clots diabetes high blood pressure and smoking also increase your risk for blood clots
                
bleeding
                
if bleeding occurs it most often affects people who have platelet counts higher than  platelets per microliter of blood signs of bleeding include nosebleeds bruising bleeding from the mouth or gums or blood in the stools
                
although bleeding usually is associated with a low platelet count it also can occur in people who have high platelet counts blood clots that develop in thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis may use up your bodys platelets this means that not enough platelets are left in your bloodstream to seal off cuts or breaks on the blood vessel walls
                
another cause of bleeding in people who have very high platelets counts is a condition called von willebrand disease this condition affects the blood clotting process
                
in rare cases of primary thrombocythemia the faulty bone marrow cells will cause a form of leukemia lukemeah leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells"
information,what is are mabry syndrome ,mabry syndrome is a condition characterized by intellectual disability distinctive facial features increased levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase in the blood hyperphosphatasia and other signs and symptoms  people with mabry syndrome have intellectual disability that is often moderate to severe they typically have little to no speech development and are delayed in the development of motor skills such as sitting crawling and walking many affected individuals have low muscle tone hypotonia and develop recurrent seizures epilepsy in early childhood seizures are usually the generalized tonicclonic type which involve muscle rigidity convulsions and loss of consciousness  individuals with mabry syndrome have distinctive facial features that include wideset eyes hypertelorism long openings of the eyelids long palpebral fissures a nose with a broad bridge and a rounded tip downturned corners of the mouth and a thin upper lip these facial features usually become less pronounced over time  hyperphosphatasia begins within the first year of life in people with mabry syndrome there are many different types of alkaline phosphatase found in tissues the type that is increased in mabry syndrome is called the tissue nonspecific type and is found throughout the body in affected individuals alkaline phosphatase levels in the blood are usually increased by one to two times the normal amount but can be up to  times higher than normal the elevated enzyme levels remain relatively stable over a persons lifetime hyperphosphatasia appears to cause no negative health effects but this finding can help health professionals diagnose mabry syndrome  another common feature of mabry syndrome is shortened bones at the ends of fingers brachytelephalangy which can be seen on xray imaging underdeveloped fingernails nail hypoplasia may also occur sometimes individuals with mabry syndrome have abnormalities of the digestive system including narrowing or blockage of the anus anal stenosis or anal atresia or hirschsprung disease a disorder that causes severe constipation or blockage of the intestine rarely affected individuals experience hearing loss  the signs and symptoms of mabry syndrome vary among affected individuals those who are least severely affected have only intellectual disability and hyperphosphatasia without distinctive facial features or the other health problems listed above
inheritance,is pyruvate kinase deficiency inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition
considerations,what to do for pregnancy and thyroid disease ,"during pregnancy the body requires higher amounts of some nutrients to support the health of the mother and growing baby experts recommend pregnant women maintain a balanced diet and take a prenatal multivitamin and mineral supplement containing iodine to receive most nutrients necessary for thyroid health more information about diet and nutrition during pregnancy is provided by the national agricultural library available at wwwchoosemyplategovnutritionalneedsduringpregnancy
                
dietary supplements
                
because the thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormone iodine is an important mineral for a mother during pregnancy during pregnancy the baby gets iodine from the mothers diet women need more iodine when they are pregnantabout  micrograms a day in the united states about  percent of pregnant women may not get enough iodine in their diet or through prenatal  choosing iodized saltsalt supplemented with iodineover plain salt and prenatal vitamins containing iodine will ensure this need is met
                
however people with autoimmune thyroid disease may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine taking iodine drops or eating foods containing large amounts of iodinesuch as seaweed dulse or kelpmay cause or worsen hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism more information about iodine is provided by the national library of medicine in the fact sheet iodine in diet
                
to help ensure coordinated and safe care people should discuss their use of dietary supplements with their health care provider tips for talking with health care providers are available at the national center for complementary and integrative healths time to talk campaign"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of severe congenital neutropenia xlinked ,what are the signs and symptoms of severe congenital neutropenia xlinked the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for severe congenital neutropenia xlinked if the information is available the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms signs and symptoms approximate number of patients when available abnormality of neutrophils  decreased antibody level in blood  abnormality of the skin  congenital neutropenia  recurrent bacterial infections  xlinked recessive inheritance  the human phenotype ontology hpo has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition much of this information comes from orphanet a european rare disease database the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature the frequency may also be listed as a fraction the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study for example a frequency of  means that in a study of  people all patients were found to have that symptom because these frequencies are based on a specific study the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined sometimes no information on frequency is available in these cases the sign or symptom may be rare or common
information,do you have information about kidney transplantation,summary  a kidney transplant is an operation that places a healthy kidney in your body the transplanted kidney takes over the work of the two kidneys that failed so you no longer need dialysis     during a transplant the surgeon places the new kidney in your lower abdomen and connects the artery and vein of the new kidney to your artery and vein often the new kidney will start making urine as soon as your blood starts flowing through it but sometimes it takes a few weeks to start working     many transplanted kidneys come from donors who have died some come from a living family member the wait for a new kidney can be long    if you have a transplant you must take drugs for the rest of your life to keep your body from rejecting the new kidney    nih national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases
exams and tests,how to diagnose diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis ,how is diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis diagnosed a diagnosis of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis dish is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms xrays may then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis in some cases a computed tomography ct scan andor magnetic resonance imaging mri may also be ordered to rule out other conditions that cause similar features

causes,what causes urinary incontinence in men ,"urinary incontinence in men results when the brain does not properly signal the bladder the sphincters do not squeeze strongly enough or both the bladder muscle may contract too much or not enough because of a problem with the muscle itself or the nerves controlling the bladder muscle damage to the sphincter muscles themselves or the nerves controlling these muscles can result in poor sphincter function these problems can range from simple to complex
                
a man may have factors that increase his chances of developing ui including
                
 birth defectsproblems with development of the urinary tract   a history of prostate cancersurgery or radiation treatment for prostate cancer can lead to temporary or permanent ui in men
                
ui is not a disease instead it can be a symptom of certain conditions or the result of particular events during a mans life conditions or events that may increase a mans chance of developing ui include
                
 benign prostatic hyperplasia bpha condition in which the prostate is enlarged yet not cancerous in men with bph the enlarged prostate presses against and pinches the urethra the bladder wall becomes thicker eventually the bladder may weaken and lose the ability to empty leaving some urine in the bladder the narrowing of the urethra and incomplete emptying of the bladder can lead to ui   chronic coughinglonglasting coughing increases pressure on the bladder and pelvic floor muscles   neurological problemsmen with diseases or conditions that affect the brain and spine may have trouble controlling urination   physical inactivitydecreased activity can increase a mans weight and contribute to muscle weakness   obesityextra weight can put pressure on the bladder causing a need to urinate before the bladder is full   older agebladder muscles can weaken over time leading to a decrease in the bladders capacity to store urine

information,what is are pulmonary vein stenosis ,pulmonary vein stenosis is a very rare and serious condition in which there is a blockage in the blood vessels that bring oxygenrich blood from the lungs back to the heart this condition can be isolated to one vein but often affects multiple veins stenosis occurs when there is an abnormal thickening and narrowing of the walls of the veins pulmonary vein stenosis is a progressive condition and may lead to total obstruction to a blood vessel most commonly all of the pulmonary veins of one lung are affected causing pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension surgery and catheterization to widen the narrow veins is usually a shortterm solution since the obstruction typically recurs
information,what is are diabetic neuropathies the nerve damage of diabetes ,"diabetic neuropathies are a family of nerve disorders caused by diabetes people with diabetes can over time develop nerve damage throughout the body some people with nerve damage have no symptoms others may have symptoms such as pain tingling or numbnessloss of feelingin the hands arms feet and legs nerve problems can occur in every organ system including the digestive tract heart and sex organs
                
about  to  percent of people with diabetes have some form of neuropathy people with diabetes can develop nerve problems at any time but risk rises with age and longer duration of diabetes the highest rates of neuropathy are among people who have had diabetes for at least  years diabetic neuropathies also appear to be more common in people who have problems controlling their blood glucose also called blood sugar as well as those with high levels of blood fat and blood pressure and those who are overweight"
causes,what causes glomerular diseases ,"a number of different diseases can result in glomerular disease it may be the direct result of an infection or a drug toxic to the kidneys or it may result from a disease that affects the entire body like diabetes or lupus many different kinds of diseases can cause swelling or scarring of the nephron or glomerulus sometimes glomerular disease is idiopathic meaning that it occurs without an apparent associated disease
                
the categories presented below can overlap that is a disease might belong to two or more of the categories for example diabetic nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that can be placed in two categories systemic diseases since diabetes itself is a systemic disease and sclerotic diseases because the specific damage done to the kidneys is associated with scarring
                
autoimmune diseases
                
when the bodys immune system functions properly it creates proteinlike substances called antibodies and immunoglobulins to protect the body against invading organisms in an autoimmune disease the immune system creates autoantibodies which are antibodies or immunoglobulins that attack the body itself autoimmune diseases may be systemic and affect many parts of the body or they may affect only specific organs or regions
                
systemic lupus erythematosus sle affects many parts of the body primarily the skin and joints but also the kidneys because women are more likely to develop sle than men some researchers believe that a sexlinked genetic factor may play a part in making a person susceptible although viral infection has also been implicated as a triggering factor lupus nephritis is the name given to the kidney disease caused by sle and it occurs when autoantibodies form or are deposited in the glomeruli causing inflammation ultimately the inflammation may create scars that keep the kidneys from functioning properly conventional treatment for lupus nephritis includes a combination of two drugs cyclophosphamide a cytotoxic agent that suppresses the immune system and prednisolone a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation a newer immunosuppressant mychophenolate mofetil mmf has been used instead of cyclophosphamide preliminary studies indicate that mmf may be as effective as cyclophosphamide and has milder side effects
                
goodpastures syndrome involves an autoantibody that specifically targets the kidneys and the lungs often the first indication that patients have the autoantibody is when they cough up blood but lung damage in goodpastures syndrome is usually superficial compared with progressive and permanent damage to the kidneys goodpastures syndrome is a rare condition that affects mostly young men but also occurs in women children and older adults treatments include immunosuppressive drugs and a bloodcleaning therapy called plasmapheresis that removes the autoantibodies
                
iga nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that results when immunoglobulin a iga forms deposits in the glomeruli where it creates inflammation iga nephropathy was not recognized as a cause of glomerular disease until the late  when sophisticated biopsy techniques were developed that could identify iga deposits in kidney tissue
                
the most common symptom of iga nephropathy is blood in the urine but it is often a silent disease that may go undetected for many years the silent nature of the disease makes it difficult to determine how many people are in the early stages of iga nephropathy when specific medical tests are the only way to detect it this disease is estimated to be the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritisthat is glomerular disease not caused by a systemic disease like lupus or diabetes mellitus it appears to affect men more than women although iga nephropathy is found in all age groups young people rarely display signs of kidney failure because the disease usually takes several years to progress to the stage where it causes detectable complications
                
no treatment is recommended for early or mild cases of iga nephropathy when the patient has normal blood pressure and less than  gram of protein in a  urine output when proteinuria exceeds  gramday treatment is aimed at protecting kidney function by reducing proteinuria and controlling blood pressure blood pressure medicinesangiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers arbsthat block a hormone called angiotensin are most effective at achieving those two goals simultaneously
                

                
hereditary nephritisalport syndrome
                
the primary indicator of alport syndrome is a family history of chronic glomerular disease although it may also involve hearing or vision impairment this syndrome affects both men and women but men are more likely to experience chronic kidney disease and sensory loss men with alport syndrome usually first show evidence of renal insufficiency while in their twenties and reach total kidney failure by age  women rarely have significant renal impairment and hearing loss may be so slight that it can be detected only through testing with special equipment usually men can pass the disease only to their daughters women can transmit the disease to either their sons or their daughters treatment focuses on controlling blood pressure to maintain kidney function
                
infectionrelated glomerular disease
                
glomerular disease sometimes develops rapidly after an infection in other parts of the body acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis psgn can occur after an episode of strep throat or in rare cases impetigo a skin infection the streptococcus bacteria do not attack the kidney directly but an infection may stimulate the immune system to overproduce antibodies which are circulated in the blood and finally deposited in the glomeruli causing damage psgn can bring on sudden symptoms of swelling edema reduced urine output oliguria and blood in the urine hematuria tests will show large amounts of protein in the urine and elevated levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen in the blood thus indicating reduced kidney function high blood pressure frequently accompanies reduced kidney function in this disease
                
psgn is most common in children between the ages of  and  although it can strike at any age and it most often affects boys it lasts only a brief time and usually allows the kidneys to recover in a few cases however kidney damage may be permanent requiring dialysis or transplantation to replace renal function
                
bacterial endocarditis infection of the tissues inside the heart is also associated with subsequent glomerular disease researchers are not sure whether the renal lesions that form after a heart infection are caused entirely by the immune response or whether some other disease mechanism contributes to kidney damage treating the heart infection is the most effective way of minimizing kidney damage endocarditis sometimes produces chronic kidney disease ckd
                
hiv the virus that leads to aids can also cause glomerular disease between  and  percent of people with hiv experience kidney failure even before developing fullblown aids hivassociated nephropathy usually begins with heavy proteinuria and progresses rapidly within a year of detection to total kidney failure researchers are looking for therapies that can slow down or reverse this rapid deterioration of renal function but some possible solutions involving immunosuppression are risky because of the patients already compromised immune system
                
sclerotic diseases
                
glomerulosclerosis is scarring sclerosis of the glomeruli in several sclerotic conditions a systemic disease like lupus or diabetes is responsible glomerulosclerosis is caused by the activation of glomerular cells to produce scar material this may be stimulated by molecules called growth factors which may be made by glomerular cells themselves or may be brought to the glomerulus by the circulating blood that enters the glomerular filter
                
diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of glomerular disease and of total kidney failure in the united states kidney disease is one of several problems caused by elevated levels of blood glucose the central feature of diabetes in addition to scarring the kidney elevated glucose levels appear to increase the speed of blood flow into the kidney putting a strain on the filtering glomeruli and raising blood pressure
                
diabetic nephropathy usually takes many years to develop people with diabetes can slow down damage to their kidneys by controlling their blood glucose through healthy eating with moderate protein intake physical activity and medications people with diabetes should also be careful to keep their blood pressure at a level below  mm hg if possible blood pressure medications called ace inhibitors and arbs are particularly effective at minimizing kidney damage and are now frequently prescribed to control blood pressure in patients with diabetes and in patients with many forms of kidney disease
                
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis fsgs describes scarring in scattered regions of the kidney typically limited to one part of the glomerulus and to a minority of glomeruli in the affected region fsgs may result from a systemic disorder or it may develop as an idiopathic kidney disease without a known cause proteinuria is the most common symptom of fsgs but since proteinuria is associated with several other kidney conditions the doctor cannot diagnose fsgs on the basis of proteinuria alone biopsy may confirm the presence of glomerular scarring if the tissue is taken from the affected section of the kidney but finding the affected section is a matter of chance especially early in the disease process when lesions may be scattered
                
confirming a diagnosis of fsgs may require repeat kidney biopsies arriving at a diagnosis of idiopathic fsgs requires the identification of focal scarring and the elimination of possible systemic causes such as diabetes or an immune response to infection since idiopathic fsgs is by definition of unknown cause it is difficult to treat no universal remedy has been found and most patients with fsgs progress to total kidney failure over  to  years some patients with an aggressive form of fsgs reach total kidney failure in  to  years treatments involving steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs appear to help some patients by decreasing proteinuria and improving kidney function but these treatments are beneficial to only a minority of those in whom they are tried and some patients experience even poorer kidney function as a result ace inhibitors and arbs may also be used in fsgs to decrease proteinuria treatment should focus on controlling blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels factors that may contribute to kidney scarring
                
other glomerular diseases
                
membranous nephropathy also called membranous glomerulopathy is the second most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome proteinuria edema high cholesterol in us adults after diabetic nephropathy diagnosis of membranous nephropathy requires a kidney biopsy which reveals unusual deposits of immunoglobulin g and complement  substances created by the bodys immune system fully  percent of cases are idiopathic which means that the cause of the disease is unknown the remaining  percent of cases are the result of other diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus hepatitis b or c infection or some forms of cancer drug therapies involving penicillamine gold or captopril have also been associated with membranous nephropathy about  to  percent of patients with membranous nephropathy progress usually over decades to total kidney failure but most patients experience either complete remission or continued symptoms without progressive kidney failure doctors disagree about how aggressively to treat this condition since about  percent of patients recover without treatment ace inhibitors and arbs are generally used to reduce proteinuria additional medication to control high blood pressure and edema is frequently required some patients benefit from steroids but this treatment does not work for everyone additional immunosuppressive medications are helpful for some patients with progressive disease
                
minimal change disease mcd is the diagnosis given when a patient has the nephrotic syndrome and the kidney biopsy reveals little or no change to the structure of glomeruli or surrounding tissues when examined by a light microscope tiny drops of a fatty substance called a lipid may be present but no scarring has taken place within the kidney mcd may occur at any age but it is most common in childhood a small percentage of patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome do not respond to steroid therapy for these patients the doctor may recommend a lowsodium diet and prescribe a diuretic to control edema the doctor may recommend the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to reduce proteinuria ace inhibitors and arbs have also been used to reduce proteinuria in patients with steroidresistant mcd these patients may respond to larger doses of steroids more prolonged use of steroids or steroids in combination with immunosuppressant drugs such as chlorambucil cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine"

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type  ,mutations in the  gene cause  the  gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in copying replicating dna producing rna a chemical cousin of dna and producing proteins  gene mutations that cause  lead to the production of a protein with reduced ability to aid in dna replication and the production of rna and proteins these problems particularly affect alphamotor neurons which are specialized cells in the brainstem and spinal cord that control muscle movements although the mechanism is unknown altered  proteins contribute to the damage of these neurons and their death over time the cumulative death of alphamotor neurons leads to breathing problems and progressive muscle weakness in children with   research suggests that the amount of functional protein that is produced from the mutated  gene may play a role in the severity of  individuals who have some functional protein are more likely to develop signs and symptoms later in childhood and retain a greater level of muscle function
inheritance,is neurofibromatosis type  inherited ,neurofibromatosis type  is considered to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance people with this condition are born with one mutated copy of the  gene in each cell in about half of cases the altered gene is inherited from an affected parent the remaining cases result from new mutations in the  gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family  unlike most other autosomal dominant conditions in which one altered copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder two copies of the  gene must be altered to trigger tumor formation in neurofibromatosis type  a mutation in the second copy of the  gene occurs during a persons lifetime in specialized cells surrounding nerves almost everyone who is born with one  mutation acquires a second mutation in many cells and develops the tumors characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to gitelman syndrome ,gitelman syndrome is usually caused by mutations in the  gene less often the condition results from mutations in the clcnkb gene the proteins produced from these genes are involved in the kidneys reabsorption of salt sodium chloride or nacl from urine back into the bloodstream mutations in either gene impair the kidneys ability to reabsorb salt leading to the loss of excess salt in the urine salt wasting abnormalities of salt transport also affect the reabsorption of other ions including ions of potassium magnesium and calcium the resulting imbalance of ions in the body underlies the major features of gitelman syndrome

if a genetic test or blood test suggests cf a doctor will confirm the diagnosis using a sweat test this test is the most useful test for diagnosing cf a sweat test measures the amount of salt in sweat
                
for this test the doctor triggers sweating on a small patch of skin on an arm or leg he or she rubs the skin with a sweatproducing chemical and then uses an electrode to provide a mild electrical current this may cause a tingling or warm feeling
                
sweat is collected on a pad or paper and then analyzed the sweat test usually is done twice high salt levels confirm a diagnosis of cf
                
other tests
                
if you or your child has cf your doctor may recommend other tests such as
                
genetic tests to find out what type of cftr defect is causing your cf
                
a chest x ray this test creates pictures of the structures in your chest such as your heart lungs and blood vessels a chest x ray can show whether your lungs are inflamed or scarred or whether they trap air
                
a sinus x ray this test may show signs of sinusitis a complication of cf
                
lung function tests these tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out how fast you can breathe air out and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood
                
a sputum culture for this test your doctor will take a sample of your sputum spit to see whether bacteria are growing in it if you have bacteria called mucoid pseudomonas you may have more advanced cf that needs aggressive treatment
                
prenatal screening
                
if youre pregnant prenatal genetic tests can show whether your fetus has cf these tests include amniocentesis amneosentesis and chorionic villus koreonik vilus sampling cvs
                
in amniocentesis your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus he or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby the fluid is tested to see whether both of the babys cftr genes are normal
                
in cvs your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta the doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction the sample is tested to see whether the baby has cf
                
cystic fibrosis carrier testing
                
people who have one normal cftr gene and one faulty cftr gene are cf carriers cf carriers usually have no symptoms of cf and live normal lives however carriers can pass faulty cftr genes on to their children
                
if you have a family history of cf or a partner who has cf or a family history of it and youre planning a pregnancy you may want to find out whether youre a cf carrier
                
a genetics counselor can test a blood or saliva sample to find out whether you have a faulty cf gene this type of testing can detect faulty cf genes in  out of  cases"

information,what is are respiratory failure ,"respiratory respihrahtore failure is a condition in which not enough oxygen passes from your lungs into your blood your bodys organs such as your heart and brain need oxygenrich blood to work well
                
respiratory failure also can occur if your lungs cant properly remove carbon dioxide a waste gas from your blood too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your bodys organs
                
both of these problemsa low oxygen level and a high carbon dioxide level in the bloodcan occur at the same time
                
diseases and conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure examples include copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and spinal cord injuries copd prevents enough air from flowing in and out of the airways spinal cord injuries can damage the nerves that control breathing
                
overview
                
to understand respiratory failure it helps to understand how the lungs work when you breathe air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe the air then travels to your lungs air sacs these sacs are called alveoli alveeuhleye
                
small blood vessels called capillaries run through the walls of the air sacs when air reaches the air sacs the oxygen in the air passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries at the same time carbon dioxide moves from the capillaries into the air sacs this process is called gas exchange
                
in respiratory failure gas exchange is impaired
                
respiratory failure can be acute short term or chronic ongoing acute respiratory failure can develop quickly and may require emergency treatment chronic respiratory failure develops more slowly and lasts longer
                
signs and symptoms of respiratory failure may include shortness of breath rapid breathing and air hunger feeling like you cant breathe in enough air in severe cases signs and symptoms may include a bluish color on your skin lips and fingernails confusion and sleepiness
                
one of the main goals of treating respiratory failure is to get oxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body another goal is to treat the underlying cause of the condition
                
acute respiratory failure usually is treated in an intensive care unit chronic respiratory failure can be treated at home or at a longterm care center
                
outlook
                
the outlook for respiratory failure depends on the severity of its underlying cause how quickly treatment begins and your overall health
                
people who have severe lung diseases may need longterm or ongoing breathing support such as oxygen therapy or the help of a ventilator ventilator a ventilator is a machine that supports breathing it blows airor air with increased amounts of oxygeninto your airways and then your lungs"
causes,what causes poland syndrome ,what causes poland syndrome the cause of poland syndrome is unknown most evidence supports the idea that something abnormal happens during the sixth week of fetal development this event most likely involves the vascular blood and lymph system speculations include an interruption of the embryonic blood supply of the arteries that lie under the collarbone subclavian arteries this could be caused by the forward growth of the ribs reducing the flow of blood a malformation of the subclavian arteries causes a reduced amount of blood delivered to the developing tissues on one side of the body
outlook,what is the outlook for gallbladder cancer ,certain factors affect the prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options the prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options depend on the following           the stage of the cancer whether the cancer has spread from the gallbladder to other places in the body     whether the cancer can be completely removed by surgery     the type of gallbladder cancer how the cancer cell looks under a microscope     whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred come back        treatment may also depend on the age and general health of the patient and whether the cancer is causing signs or symptoms   gallbladder cancer can be cured only if it is found before it has spread when it can be removed by surgery if the cancer has spread palliative treatment can improve the patients quality of life by controlling the symptoms and complications of this disease   taking part in one of the clinical trials being done to improve treatment should be considered information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the nci website

causes,what causes tarp syndrome ,what causes tarp syndrome tarp syndrome is a genetic condition caused by mutations in the  gene which is located on the x chromosome there is little information available about how mutations in this gene specifically cause tarp syndrome however in  researchers showed that the  gene is expressed in mouse embryos in the branchial arches embryonic structures that give rise to parts of the head and neck and limbs which is consistent with body parts known to be affected in individuals with tarp syndrome the signs and symptoms of tarp syndrome occur when this gene does not function correctly
exams and tests,how to diagnose cold urticaria ,how is cold urticaria diagnosed a diagnosis of cold urticaria is typically suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and determine if there are other associated conditions this generally involves a cold simulation test in which a cold object such as an ice cube is applied against the skin of the forearm for  minutes in people affected by cold urticaria a distinct red and swollen rash will generally develop within minutes of exposure a complete blood count andor metabolic tests may also be performed to determine associated diseases
information,what is are parkinsons disease ,parkinsons disease pd belongs to a group of conditions called motor system disorders which are the result of the loss of dopamineproducing brain cells the four primary symptoms of pd are tremor or trembling in hands arms legs jaw and face rigidity or stiffness of the limbs and trunk bradykinesia or slowness of movement and postural instability or impaired balance and coordination as these symptoms become more pronounced patients may have difficulty walking talking or completing other simple tasks pd usually affects people over the age of  early symptoms of pd are subtle and occur gradually in some people the disease progresses more quickly than in others as the disease progresses the shaking or tremor which affects the majority of people with pd may begin to interfere with daily activities other symptoms may include depression and other emotional changes difficulty in swallowing chewing and speaking urinary problems or constipation skin problems and sleep disruptions there are currently no blood or laboratory tests that have been proven to help in diagnosing sporadic pd therefore the diagnosis is based on medical history and a neurological examination the disease can be difficult to diagnose accurately doctors may sometimes request brain scans or laboratory tests in order to rule out other diseases

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to congenital diaphragmatic hernia ,congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes in  to  percent of affected individuals the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems called a syndrome donnaibarrow syndrome fryns syndrome and pallisterkillian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes  about  percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems affected body systems can include the heart brain skeleton intestines genitals kidneys or eyes in these individuals the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear  approximately  to  percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations  more than  percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality in these cases the cause of the condition is unknown researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia some of these genes are transcription factors which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes gene expression others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement migration of cells in the embryo environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia but these environmental factors have not been identified
information,what is are coronavirus infections ,coronaviruses are common viruses that most people get some time in their life they are common throughout the world and they can infect people and animals several different coronaviruses can infect people and make them sick they usually cause mild to moderate upperrespiratory illness but some coronaviruses can cause severe illness    coronaviruses probably spread through the air by coughing or sneezing or by close personal contact if you get infected symptoms may include        runny nose     cough     sore throat     fever       you may be able to reduce your risk of infection by washing your hands often with soap and water not touching your eyes nose or mouth and avoiding close contact with people who are sick there is no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection there are no specific treatments you can relieve symptoms with pain and fever medicines and rest    centers for disease control and prevention
treatment,what are the treatments for aidsrelated lymphoma ,"key points
                     there are different types of treatment for patients with aidsrelated lymphoma      treatment of aidsrelated lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for aids     four types of standard treatment are used          chemotherapy       radiation therapy      highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant      targeted therapy         new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials      patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with aidsrelated lymphoma
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with aidsrelated lymphoma some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    treatment of aidsrelated lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for aids
                    patients with aids have weakened immune systems and treatment can cause the immune system to become even weaker for this reason treating patients who have aidsrelated lymphoma is difficult and some patients may be treated with lower doses of drugs than lymphoma patients who do not have aids    combined antiretroviral therapy cart is used to lessen the damage to the immune system caused by hiv treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy may allow some patients with aidsrelated lymphoma to safely receive anticancer drugs in standard or higher doses in these patients treatment may work as well as it does in lymphoma patients who do not have aids medicine to prevent and treat infections which can be serious is also used   for more information about aids and its treatment please see the aidsinfo website
                
                
                    four types of standard treatment are used
                    chemotherapy      chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid intrathecal chemotherapy an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    the way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed intrathecal chemotherapy may be used in patients who are more likely to have lymphoma in the central nervous system cns       chemotherapy is used in the treatment of aidsrelated peripheralsystemic lymphoma it is not yet known whether it is best to give combined antiretroviral therapy at the same time as chemotherapy or after chemotherapy ends     colonystimulating factors are sometimes given together with chemotherapy this helps lessen the side effects chemotherapy may have on the bone marrow       radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy              external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer       internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer            the way the radiation therapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed external radiation therapy is used to treat aidsrelated primary cns lymphoma       highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     highdose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored after the chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the bodys blood cells        targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy    monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion these may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells rituximab is used in the treatment of aidsrelated peripheralsystemic lymphoma
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    information about clinical trials is available from the nci website
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

information,what is are generalized gangliosidoses ,"the gangliosidoses are a group of inherited metabolic diseases caused by a deficiency of the different proteins needed to break down fatty substances called lipids excess buildup of these fatty materials oils waxes steroids and other compounds can cause permanent damage in the cells and tissues in the brain and nervous systems particularly in nerve cells there are two distinct groups of the gangliosidoses which affect males and females equally
                
the  gangliosidoses are caused by a deficiency of the enzyme betagalactosidase signs of early infantile  gangliodisosis the most severe subtype with onset shortly after birth may include neurodegeneration seizures liver and spleen enlargement coarsening of facial features skeletal irregularities joint stiffness distended abdomen muscle weakness exaggerated startle response and problems with gait about half of affected persons develop cherryred spots in the eye children may be deaf and blind by age  of late infantile  gangliosidosisis typically between ages  and  years signs include an inability to control movement seizures dementia and difficulties with speech adult  gangliosidosis strikes between ages  and  with symptoms that include the wasting away of muscles cloudiness in the corneas and dystonia sustained moscle contractions that case twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures noncancerous skin blemishes may develop on the lower part of the trunk of the body adult  is usually less severe and progresses more slowly than other forms of the disorder
                
the  gangliosidoses include taysachs disease and its more severe form called sandhoff disease both of whichresult from a deficiency of the enzyme betahexosaminidase symptoms begin by age  months and include progressive mental deterioration cherryred spots in the retina marked startle reflex and seizures children with taysachs may also have dementia progressive loss of hearing some paralysis and difficulty in swallowing that may require a feeding tube a rarer form of the disorder which occurs in individuals in their twenties and early thirties is characterized by an unsteady gait and progressive neurological deterioration additional signs of sandhoff disease include weakness in nerve signaling that causes muscles to contract early blindness spasticity muscle contractions an abnormally enlarged head and an enlarged liver and spleen"
causes,what causes psoriasis ,although the cause of psoriasis is not completely understood scientists believe it is related to a problem with a type of blood cells called t cells these cells normally travel through the bloodstream to help fight an infection but in people with psoriasis they attack the bodys skin cells by mistake genes play a role no one knows what causes t cells to go wrong but certain genes have been linked to psoriasis people who have these genes are more likely to develop psoriasis than people without the genes however genes alone do not cause psoriasis scientists believe psoriasis occurs when something in the environment triggers the disease in someone who has one or more of these genes  psoriasis triggers these socalled triggers may be different for different people different triggers may start the disease or make it worse in different people factors that may trigger psoriasis or make it worse include  physical and emotional stress   injury to the skin such as cuts or burns   infections particularly strep throat   cold weather    smoking or heavy alcohol use   certain medications such as      lithium a psychiatric drug    antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine     inderal a high blood pressure medicine    quinidine a heart medication    indomethacin a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug often used to treat arthritis   physical and emotional stress injury to the skin such as cuts or burns infections particularly strep throat cold weather smoking or heavy alcohol use certain medications such as  lithium a psychiatric drug   antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine    inderal a high blood pressure medicine   quinidine a heart medication   indomethacin a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug often used to treat arthritis lithium a psychiatric drug antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine inderal a high blood pressure medicine quinidine a heart medication indomethacin a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug often used to treat arthritis

causes,what causes broken heart syndrome ,"the cause of broken heart syndrome isnt fully known however extreme emotional or physical stress is believed to play a role in causing the temporary disorder
                
although symptoms are similar to those of a heart attack what is happening to the heart is quite different most heart attacks are caused by near or complete blockage of a coronary artery in broken heart syndrome the coronary arteries are not blocked although blood flow may be reduced
                
potential triggers
                
in most cases broken heart syndrome occurs after an intense and upsetting emotional or physical event some potential triggers of broken heart syndrome are
                
emotional stressorsextreme grief fear or anger for example as a result of the unexpected death of a loved one financial or legal trouble intense fear domestic abuse confrontational argument car accident public speaking or even a surprise party
                
physical stressorsan asthma attack serious illness or surgery or exhausting physical effort
                
potential causes
                
researchers think that sudden stress releases hormones that overwhelm or stun the heart the term stunned is often used to indicate that the injury to the heart muscle is only temporary this can trigger changes in heart muscle cells or coronary blood vessels or both the heart becomes so weak that its left ventricle which is the chamber that pumps blood from your heart to your body bulges and cannot pump well while the other parts of the heart work normally or with even more forceful contractions as a result the heart is unable to pump properly for more information about the hearts pumping action and blood flow go to the health topics how the heart works article
                
researchers are trying to identify the precise way in which the stress hormones affect the heart broken heart syndrome may result from a hormone surge coronary artery spasm or microvascular dysfunction
                
hormone surge
                
intense stress causes large amounts of the fight or flight hormones such as adrenaline and noradrenaline to be released into your bloodstream the hormones are meant to help you cope with the stress researchers think that the sudden surge of hormones overwhelms and stuns the heart muscle producing symptoms similar to those of a heart attack
                
coronary artery spasm
                
some research suggests that the extreme stress causes a temporary sudden narrowing of one of the coronary arteries as a result of a spasm the spasm slows or stops blood flow through the artery and starves part of the heart of oxygenrich blood
                
microvascular dysfunction
                
another theory that is gaining traction is that the very small coronary arteries called microvascular arteries do not function well due to low hormone levels occurring before or after menopause the microvascular arteries fail to provide enough oxygenrich blood to the heart muscle"

information,what is are short qt syndrome ,short qt syndrome is a condition that can cause a disruption of the hearts normal rhythm arrhythmia in people with this condition the heart cardiac muscle takes less time than usual to recharge between beats the term short qt refers to a specific pattern of heart activity that is detected with an electrocardiogram ekg which is a test used to measure the electrical activity of the heart in people with this condition the part of the heartbeat known as the qt interval is abnormally short  if untreated the arrhythmia associated with short qt syndrome can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms from dizziness and fainting syncope to cardiac arrest and sudden death these signs and symptoms can occur any time from early infancy to old age this condition may explain some cases of sudden infant death syndrome sids which is a major cause of unexplained death in babies younger than  year however some people with short qt syndrome never experience any health problems associated with the condition
susceptibility,who is at risk for parasites  american trypanosomiasis also known as chagas disease ,"chagas disease or american trypanosomiasis is caused by the parasite trypanosoma cruzi infection is most commonly acquired through contact with the feces of an infected triatomine bug or kissing bug a bloodsucking insect that feeds on humans and animals
    
infection can also occur from
    
      mothertobaby congenital
      contaminated blood products transfusions
      an organ transplanted from an infected donor
      laboratory accident or
      contaminated food or drink rare
    
    
chagas disease is endemic throughout much of mexico central america and south america where an estimated  million people are infected the triatomine bug thrives under poor housing conditions for example mud walls thatched roofs so in endemic countries people living in rural areas are at greatest risk for acquiring infection public health efforts aimed at preventing transmission have decreased the number of newly infected people and completely halted vectorborne transmission in some areas infection acquired from blood products organ transplantation or congenital transmission continues to pose a threat

exams and tests,how to diagnose insomnia ,"your doctor will likely diagnose insomnia based on your medical and sleep histories and a physical exam he or she also may recommend a sleep study for example you may have a sleep study if the cause of your insomnia is unclear
                
medical history
                
to find out whats causing your insomnia your doctor may ask whether you
                
have any new or ongoing health problems
                
have painful injuries or health conditions such as arthritis
                
take any medicines either overthecounter or prescription
                
have symptoms or a history of depression anxiety or psychosis
                
are coping with highly stressful life events such as divorce or death
                
your doctor also may ask questions about your work and leisure habits for example he or she may ask about your work and exercise routines your use of caffeine tobacco and alcohol and your longdistance travel history your answers can give clues about whats causing your insomnia
                
your doctor also may ask whether you have any new or ongoing work or personal problems or other stresses in your life also he or she may ask whether you have other family members who have sleep problems
                
sleep history
                
to get a better sense of your sleep problem your doctor will ask you for details about your sleep habits before your visit think about how to describe your problems including
                
how often you have trouble sleeping and how long youve had the problem
                
when you go to bed and get up on workdays and days off
                
how long it takes you to fall asleep how often you wake up at night and how long it takes to fall back asleep
                
whether you snore loudly and often or wake up gasping or feeling out of breath
                
how refreshed you feel when you wake up and how tired you feel during the day
                
how often you doze off or have trouble staying awake during routine tasks especially driving
                
to find out whats causing or worsening your insomnia your doctor also may ask you
                
whether you worry about falling asleep staying asleep or getting enough sleep
                
what you eat or drink and whether you take medicines before going to bed
                
what routine you follow before going to bed
                
what the noise level lighting and temperature are like where you sleep
                
what distractions such as a tv or computer are in your bedroom
                
to help your doctor consider keeping a sleep diary for  or  weeks write down when you go to sleep wake up and take naps for example you might note went to bed at  am woke up at  am and couldnt fall back asleep napped after work for  hours
                
also write down how much you sleep each night as well as how sleepy you feel throughout the day
                
you can find a sample sleep diary in the national heart lung and blood institutes your guide to healthy sleep
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will do a physical exam to rule out other medical problems that might cause insomnia you also may need blood tests to check for thyroid problems or other conditions that can cause sleep problems
                
sleep study
                
your doctor may recommend a sleep study called a polysomnogram psg if he or she thinks an underlying sleep disorder is causing your insomnia
                
youll likely stay overnight at a sleep center for this study the psg records brain activity eye movements heart rate and blood pressure
                
a psg also records the amount of oxygen in your blood how much air is moving through your nose while you breathe snoring and chest movements the chest movements show whether youre making an effort to breathe"

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to kniest dysplasia ,kniest dysplasia is one of a spectrum of skeletal disorders caused by mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms type ii collagen this type of collagen is found mostly in the clear gel that fills the eyeball the vitreous and in cartilage cartilage is a tough flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development most cartilage is later converted to bone except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears type ii collagen is essential for the normal development of bones and other connective tissues that form the bodys supportive framework  most mutations in the  gene that cause kniest dysplasia interfere with the assembly of type ii collagen molecules abnormal collagen prevents bones and other connective tissues from developing properly which leads to the signs and symptoms of kniest dysplasia
symptoms,what are the symptoms of carotid artery disease ,"carotid artery disease may not cause signs or symptoms until it severely narrows or blocks a carotid artery signs and symptoms may include a bruit a transient ischemic attacktia or a stroke
                
bruit
                
during a physical exam your doctor may listen to your carotid arteries with a stethoscope he or she may hear a whooshing sound called a bruit this sound may suggest changed or reduced blood flow due to plaque buildup to find out more your doctor may recommend tests
                
not all people who have carotid artery disease have bruits
                
transient ischemic attack ministroke
                
for some people having a transient ischemic attack tia or ministroke is the first sign of carotid artery disease during a ministroke you may have some or all of the symptoms of a stroke however the symptoms usually go away on their own within  hours
                
stroke and ministroke symptoms may include
                
a sudden severe headache with no known cause
                
dizziness or loss of balance
                
inability to move one or more of your limbs
                
sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
                
sudden weakness or numbness in the face or limbs often on just one side of the body
                
trouble speaking or understanding speech
                
even if the symptoms stop quickly call  for emergency help do not drive yourself to the hospital its important to get checked and to get treatment started as soon as possible
                
a ministroke is a warning sign that youre at high risk of having a stroke you shouldnt ignore these symptoms getting medical care can help find possible causes of a ministroke and help you manage risk factors these actions might prevent a future stroke
                
although a ministroke may warn of a stroke it doesnt predict when a stroke will happen a stroke may occur days weeks or even months after a ministroke
                
stroke
                
the symptoms of a stroke are the same as those of a ministroke but the results are not a stroke can cause lasting brain damage longterm disability such as vision or speech problems or paralysis an inability to move or death most people who have strokes have not previously had warning ministrokes
                
getting treatment for a stroke right away is very important you have the best chance for full recovery if treatment to open a blocked artery is given within  hours of symptom onset the sooner treatment occurs the better your chances of recovery
                
call  for emergency help as soon as symptoms occur do not drive yourself to the hospital its very important to get checked and to get treatment started as soon as possible
                
make those close to you aware of stroke symptoms and the need for urgent action learning the signs and symptoms of a stroke will allow you to help yourself or someone close to you lower the risk of brain damage or death due to a stroke"

inheritance,is jejunal atresia inherited ,is jejunal atresia inherited most cases of jejunal atresia occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition however it can rarely affect more than one family member in these families jejunal atresia is likely due to a genetic cause and appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive or multifactorial manner
susceptibility,who is at risk for bile duct cancer cholangiocarcinoma ,having colitis or certain liver diseases can increase the risk of bile duct cancer anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer people who think they may be at risk should discuss this with their doctor    risk factors for bile duct cancer include the following conditions          primary sclerosing cholangitis a progressive disease in which the bile ducts become blocked by inflammation and scarring      chronic ulcerative colitis      cysts in the bile ducts cysts block the flow of bile and can cause swollen bile ducts inflammation and infection     infection with a chinese liver fluke parasite
inheritance,is leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency ,mutations in the hadha and hadhb genes cause mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency these genes each provide instructions for making part of an enzyme complex called mitochondrial trifunctional protein this enzyme complex functions in mitochondria the energyproducing centers within cells as the name suggests mitochondrial trifunctional protein contains three enzymes that each perform a different function this enzyme complex is required to break down metabolize a group of fats called longchain fatty acids longchain fatty acids are found in foods such as milk and certain oils these fatty acids are stored in the bodys fat tissues fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles during periods of fasting fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues  mutations in the hadha or hadhb genes that cause mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency disrupt all three functions of this enzyme complex without enough of this enzyme complex longchain fatty acids from food and body fat cannot be metabolized and processed as a result these fatty acids are not converted to energy which can lead to some features of this disorder such as lethargy and hypoglycemia longchain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may also build up and damage the liver heart and muscles this abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency
causes,what causes parkinson disease ,what causes parkinson disease parkinson disease occurs when the nerve cells in the brain that make dopamine a chemical messenger which transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements are slowly destroyed without dopamine the nerve cells in the part of the brain known as the substantia nigra cannot properly send messages this leads to progressive loss of muscle function exactly why these brain cells waste away is unknown recent studies have shown that people with parkinson disease also experience damage to the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine norepinephrine which is closely related to dopamine is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system the part of the nervous system that controls the automatic functions of the body including pulse and blood pressure the loss of norepinephrine may explain some of the nonmotor features seen in parkinson disease including fatigue and problems with blood pressure regulation  more detailed information about the cause of parkinson disease is available through an information page developed by the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke ninds click here to view this information
exams and tests,how to diagnose childhood interstitial lung disease ,"doctors diagnose childhood interstitial lung disease child based on a childs medical and family histories and the results from tests and procedures to diagnose child doctors may first need to rule out other diseases as the cause of a childs symptoms
                
early diagnosis of child may help doctors stop or even reverse lung function problems often though doctors find child hard to diagnose because
                
there are many types of the disease and a range of underlying causes
                
the diseases signs and symptoms are the same as those for many other diseases
                
the disease may coexist with other diseases
                
going to a pediatric pulmonologist who has experience with child is helpful a pediatric pulmonologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating children who have lung diseases and conditions
                
medical and family histories
                
your childs medical history can help his or her doctor diagnose child the doctor may ask whether your child
                
has severe breathing problems that occur often
                
has had severe lung infections
                
had serious lung problems as a newborn
                
has been exposed to possible lung irritants in the environment such as birds molds dusts or chemicals
                
has ever had radiation or chemotherapy treatment
                
has an autoimmune disease certain birth defects or other medical conditions autoimmune diseases occur if the bodys immune system mistakenly attacks the bodys tissues and cells
                
the doctor also may ask how old your child was when symptoms began and whether other family members have or have had severe lung diseases if they have your child may have an inherited form of child
                
diagnostic tests and procedures
                
no single test can diagnose the many types of child thus your childs doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests for some of these tests infants and young children may be given medicine to help them relax or sleep
                
a chest x ray this painless test creates pictures of the structures inside your childs chest such as the heart lungs and blood vessels a chest x ray can help rule out other lung diseases as the cause of your childs symptoms
                
a highresolution ct scan hrct an hrct scan uses x rays to create detailed pictures of your childs lungs this test can show the location extent and severity of lung disease
                
lung function tests these tests measure how much air your child can breathe in and out how fast he or she can breathe air out and how well your childs lungs deliver oxygen to the blood lung function tests can assess the severity of lung disease infants and young children may need to have these tests at a center that has special equipment for children
                
bronchoalveolar lavage brongkoalveolar lahvahzh for this procedure the doctor injects a small amount of saline salt water through a tube inserted in the childs lungs the fluid helps bring up cells from the tissues around the air sacs the doctor can then look at these cells under a microscope this procedure can help detect an infection lung injury bleeding aspiration or an airway problem
                
various tests to rule out conditions such as asthma cystic fibrosis acid reflux heart disease neuromuscular disease and immune deficiency
                
various tests for systemic diseases linked to child systemic diseases are diseases that involve many of the bodys organs
                
blood tests to check for inherited genetic diseases and disorders
                
if these tests dont provide enough information your childs doctor may recommend a lung biopsy a lung biopsy is the most reliable way to diagnose child and the specific disease involved
                
a lung biopsy is a surgical procedure thats done in a hospital before the biopsy your child will receive medicine to make him or her sleep
                
during the biopsy the doctor will take small samples of lung tissue from several places in your childs lungs this often is done using videoassisted thoracoscopy thorahkoskope
                
for this procedure the doctor inserts a small tube with a light and camera endoscope into your childs chest through small cuts between the ribs the endoscope provides a video image of the lungs and allows the doctor to collect tissue samples
                
after the biopsy the doctor will look at these samples under a microscope"

exams and tests,how to diagnose adiposis dolorosa ,is genetic testing available for adiposis dolorosa clinical genetic testing for adiposis dolorosa is currently not available this type of testing is typically only available when a genetic cause for a condition has been established and the specific genes causing the condition have been identified most cases of adiposis dolorosa are sporadic not inherited and no genes known to be associated with the condition have been identified we are also not aware of laboratories currently offering research genetic testing for this condition
causes,what causes gastritis ,"common causes of gastritis include
                
 helicobacter pylori h pylori infection   damage to the stomach lining which leads to reactive gastritis   an autoimmune response
                
h pylori infection h pylori is a type of bacteriaorganisms that may cause an infection h pylori infection
                
 causes most cases of gastritis   typically causes nonerosive gastritis   may cause acute or chronic gastritis
                
h pylori infection is common particularly in developing countries and the infection often begins in childhood many people who are infected with h pylori never have any symptoms adults are more likely to show symptoms when symptoms do occur
                
researchers are not sure how the h pylori infection spreads although they think contaminated food water or eating utensils may transmit the bacteria some infected people have h pylori in their saliva which suggests that infection can spread through direct contact with saliva or other body fluids
                
more information about peptic ulcer disease and h pylori is provided in the niddk health topic peptic ulcer disease
                
damage to the stomach lining which leads to reactive gastritis some people who have damage to the stomach lining can develop reactive gastritis
                
reactive gastritis
                
 may be acute or chronic   may cause erosions   may cause little or no inflammation
                
reactive gastritis may also be called reactive gastropathy when it causes little or no inflammation
                
the causes of reactive gastritis may include
                
 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids a type of overthecounter medication aspirin and ibuprofen are common types of nsaids   drinking alcohol   using cocaine   exposure to radiation or having radiation treatments   reflux of bile from the small intestine into the stomach bile reflux may occur in people who have had part of their stomach removed   a reaction to stress caused by traumatic injuries critical illness severe burns and major surgery this type of reactive gastritis is called stress gastritis
                
an autoimmune response in autoimmune gastritis the immune system attacks healthy cells in the stomach lining the immune system normally protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria viruses and other potentially harmful foreign substances autoimmune gastritis is chronic and typically nonerosive
                
less common causes of gastritis may include
                
 crohns disease which causes inflammation and irritation of any part of the gastrointestinal gi tract   sarcoidosis a disease that causes inflammation that will not go away the chronic inflammation causes tiny clumps of abnormal tissue to form in various organs in the body the disease typically starts in the lungs skin and lymph nodes   allergies to food such as cows milk and soy especially in children   infections with viruses parasites fungi and bacteria other than h pylori typically in people with weakened immune systems"
information,what is are primary orthostatic tremor ,primary orthostatic tremor is a movement disorder characterized by rhythmic muscle contractions that occur in the legs and trunk immediately after standing it may be perceived more as an unsteadiness than an actual tremor the tremor may disappear or improve when a person is sitting or walking over time the tremors may become more severe affecting quality of life and causing increasing disability in some cases primary orthostatic tremor may occur with other movement disorders individuals with primary orthostatic tremor may be treated with clonazepam and primidone the cause of this condition is unknown
causes,what causes pernicious anemia ,"pernicious anemia is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor or other causes such as infections surgery medicines or diet
                
lack of intrinsic factor
                
intrinsic factor is a protein made in the stomach it helps your body absorb vitamin  in some people an autoimmune response causes a lack of intrinsic factor
                
an autoimmune response occurs if the bodys immune system makes antibodies proteins that mistakenly attack and damage the bodys tissues or cells
                
in pernicious anemia the body makes antibodies that attack and destroy the parietal pariehtal cells these cells line the stomach and make intrinsic factor why this autoimmune response occurs isnt known
                
as a result of this attack the stomach stops making intrinsic factor without intrinsic factor your body cant move vitamin  through the small intestine where its absorbed this leads to vitamin  deficiency
                
a lack of intrinsic factor also can occur if youve had part or all of your stomach surgically removed this type of surgery reduces the number of parietal cells available to make intrinsic factor
                
rarely children are born with an inherited disorder that prevents their bodies from making intrinsic factor this disorder is called congenital pernicious anemia
                
other causes
                
pernicious anemia also has other causes besides a lack of intrinsic factor malabsorption in the small intestine and a diet lacking vitamin  both can lead to pernicious anemia
                
malabsorption in the small intestine
                
sometimes pernicious anemia occurs because the bodys small intestine cant properly absorb vitamin  this may be the result of
                
too many of the wrong kind of bacteria in the small intestine this is a common cause of pernicious anemia in older adults the bacteria use up the available vitamin  before the small intestine can absorb it
                
diseases that interfere with vitamin  absorption one example is celiac disease this is a genetic disorder in which your body cant tolerate a protein called gluten another example is crohns disease an inflammatory bowel disease hiv also may interfere with vitamin  absorption
                
certain medicines that alter bacterial growth or prevent the small intestine from properly absorbing vitamin  examples include antibiotics and certain diabetes and seizure medicines
                
surgical removal of part or all of the small intestine
                
a tapeworm infection the tapeworm feeds off of the vitamin  eating undercooked infected fish may cause this type of infection
                
diet lacking vitamin 
                
some people get pernicious anemia because they dont have enough vitamin  in their diets this cause of pernicious anemia is less common than other causes
                
good food sources of vitamin  include
                
breakfast cereals with added vitamin 
                
meats such as beef liver poultry and fish
                
eggs and dairy products such as milk yogurt and cheese
                
foods fortified with vitamin  such as soybased beverages and vegetarian burgers
                
strict vegetarians who dont eat any animal or dairy products and dont take a vitamin  supplement are at risk for pernicious anemia
                
breastfed infants of strict vegetarian mothers also are at risk for pernicious anemia these infants can develop anemia within months of being born this is because they havent had enough time to store vitamin  in their bodies doctors treat these infants with vitamin  supplements
                
other groups such as the elderly and people who suffer from alcoholism also may be at risk for pernicious anemia these people may not get the proper nutrients in their diets"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of adiposis dolorosa ,what are the signs and symptoms of adiposis dolorosa adiposis dolorosa is primarily characterized by the development of muliple painful lipomas benign fatty tumors it is often associated with obesity physical weakness and lack of energy and various other symptoms including depression confusion dementia andor epilepsy seizures the lipomas may occur anywhere in the body except the face and neck the most common sites are the knees upper thighs back and upper arms they may cause joint pain arthralgia when they are near the joints pain associated with the lipomas can be debilitating it usually worsens with movement or an increase in body weight sparse pubic hair and underarm hair have been reported in some affected people the condition can also be associated with early congestive heart failure severe hypothyroidism joint pain flushing episodes tremors cyanosis high blood pressure headaches and nosebleeds the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for adiposis dolorosa if the information is available the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms signs and symptoms approximate number of patients when available arthralgia  obesity  abnormal hair quantity  arthritis  autoimmunity  bruising susceptibility  constipation  developmental regression  diarrhea  dry skin  hypothyroidism  keratoconjunctivitis sicca  memory impairment  migraine  paresthesia  seizures  skin ulcer  sleep disturbance  telangiectasia of the skin  xerostomia  anxiety  autosomal dominant inheritance  chronic pain  fatigue  middle age onset  painful subcutaneous lipomas  the human phenotype ontology hpo has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition much of this information comes from orphanet a european rare disease database the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature the frequency may also be listed as a fraction the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study for example a frequency of  means that in a study of  people all patients were found to have that symptom because these frequencies are based on a specific study the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined sometimes no information on frequency is available in these cases the sign or symptom may be rare or common
information,what is are mycobacterial infections ,mycobacteria are a type of germ there are many different kinds the most common one causes tuberculosis another one causes leprosy still others cause infections that are called atypical mycobacterial infections they arent typical because they dont cause tuberculosis but they can still harm people especially people with other problems that affect their immunity such as aids    sometimes you can have these infections with no symptoms at all at other times they can cause lung symptoms similar to tuberculosis        cough     weight loss     coughing up blood or mucus     weakness or fatigue     fever and chills     night sweats     lack of appetite and weight loss       medicines can treat these infections but often more than one is needed to cure the infection

information,what is are spinal cord diseases ,your spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that runs down the middle of your back it carries signals back and forth between your body and your brain it is protected by your vertebrae which are the bone disks that make up your spine if you have an accident that damages the vertebrae or other parts of the spine this can also injure the spinal cord other spinal cord problems include         tumors      infections such as meningitis and polio      inflammatory diseases      autoimmune diseases       degenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy       symptoms vary but might include pain numbness loss of sensation and muscle weakness these symptoms can occur around the spinal cord and also in other areas such as your arms and legs treatments often include medicines and surgery
causes,what causes  microdeletion ,what causes a  microdeletion a  microdeletion may occur randomly for the first time in an affected person a de novo mutation or it may be inherited from a parent with the microdeletion a blood test to look at the parents chromosomes is needed to find out how the microdeletion occurred when a  microdeletion occurs as a de novo mutation it is due to a random error  either during the formation of a parents egg or sperm cell or very soon after conception fertilization of the egg a parent with the microdeletion has a  chance with each pregnancy to pass on the microdeletion the features of  microdeletion occur because the deleted region of the chromosome contains several genes that are important for normal growth and development it is not yet clear why there is a large range of features and severity among people with a  microdeletion or why some people are unaffected
information,what is are eating disorders ,eating disorders are serious behavior problems they can include severe overeating or not consuming enough food to stay healthy they also involve extreme concern about your shape or weight    types of eating disorders include        anorexia nervosa in which you become too thin but you dont eat enough because you think you are fat      bulimia nervosa which involves periods of overeating followed by purging sometimes through selfinduced vomiting or using laxatives     bingeeating which is outofcontrol eating       women are more likely than men to have eating disorders they usually start in the teenage years and often occur along with depression anxiety disorders and substance abuse    eating disorders can lead to heart and kidney problems and even death getting help early is important treatment involves monitoring talk therapy nutritional counseling and sometimes medicines     nih national institute of mental health
treatment,what are the treatments for crigler najjar syndrome type  ,how might crigler najjar syndrome type  be treated treatment for crigler najjar syndrome type  is based on trying to reduce bilirubin levels as a result it is commonly treated with aggressive phototherapy and phenobarbitol for severe disease calcium gluconate intravenous fluids and albumin may be recommended severely affected patients have been treated with plasmapheresis and even liver transplantation these options may be most relevant for individuals with the more severe type i disease in type ii disease much of the literature supports that longterm reduction in serum bilirubin levels can be achieved with continued administration of phenobarbital we recommend that you continue to work closely with your primary health care provider in monitoring your bilirubin levels and the effectiveness of the prescribed therapy
considerations,what to do for prevent diabetes problems keep your kidneys healthy ,"your dietitian or doctor may suggest a special eating plan for you you may have to avoid a diet high in protein fat sodium and potassium
                
 cut back on protein especially animal products such as meat damaged kidneys may fail to remove protein waste products from your blood diets high in protein make your kidneys work harder and fail sooner   avoid a highfat diet highfat diets are high in cholesterol cholesterol is a type of fat found in your bodys cells blood and many foods your body needs some cholesterol to work the right way for example your body uses cholesterol to make certain essential hormones and maintain nerve function however your body makes all the cholesterol it needs if you often eat foods that are high in cholesterol or if high cholesterol runs in your family extra cholesterol in your blood can build up over time in the walls of your blood vessels and arteries high blood cholesterol can lead to heart disease and stroke some of the biggest health problems for people with diabetes   avoid highsodium foods sodium is a mineral found in salt and other foods high levels of sodium may raise your blood pressure some highsodium foods include canned food frozen dinners and hot dogs the amount of sodium is listed on the food label so you can see which foods have the highest levels try to limit your sodium to less than a teaspoon a day or about  milligrams mg a day if you have high blood pressure or are african american middleaged or older aim for no more than  mg of sodium per day ask your doctor or your dietitian about how much sodium you can have   ask your doctor about the amount of potassium you need potassium is a mineral that helps your heartbeat stay regular and muscles work right healthy kidneys keep the right amount of potassium in your body however if you have severe kidney damage high levels of potassium may cause an abnormal heart rhythm or even make your heart stop called cardiac arrest some highpotassium foods include apricots bananas oranges and potatoes

treatment,what are the treatments for irondeficiency anemia ,"treatment for irondeficiency anemia will depend on its cause and severity treatments may include dietary changes and supplements medicines and surgery
                
severe irondeficiency anemia may require a blood transfusion iron injections or intravenous iv iron therapy treatment may need to be done in a hospital
                
the goals of treating irondeficiency anemia are to treat its underlying cause and restore normal levels of red blood cells hemoglobin and iron
                
dietary changes and supplements
                
iron
                
you may need iron supplements to build up your iron levels as quickly as possible iron supplements can correct low iron levels within months supplements come in pill form or in drops for children
                
large amounts of iron can be harmful so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes keep iron supplements out of reach from children this will prevent them from taking an overdose of iron
                
iron supplements can cause side effects such as dark stools stomach irritation and heartburn iron also can cause constipation so your doctor may suggest that you use a stool softener
                
your doctor may advise you to eat more foods that are rich in iron the best source of iron is red meat especially beef and liver chicken turkey pork fish and shellfish also are good sources of iron
                
the body tends to absorb iron from meat better than iron from nonmeat foods however some nonmeat foods also can help you raise your iron levels examples of nonmeat foods that are good sources of iron include
                
ironfortified breads and cereals
                
peas lentils white red and baked beans soybeans and chickpeas
                
tofu
                
dried fruits such as prunes raisins and apricots
                
spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables
                
prune juice
                
the nutrition facts labels on packaged foods will show how much iron the items contain the amount is given as a percentage of the total amount of iron you need every day
                
vitamin c
                
vitamin c helps the body absorb iron good sources of vitamin c are vegetables and fruits especially citrus fruits citrus fruits include oranges grapefruits tangerines and similar fruits fresh and frozen fruits vegetables and juices usually have more vitamin c than canned ones
                
if youre taking medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist whether you can eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice grapefruit can affect the strength of a few medicines and how well they work
                
other fruits rich in vitamin c include kiwi fruit strawberries and cantaloupes
                
vegetables rich in vitamin c include broccoli peppers brussels sprouts tomatoes cabbage potatoes and leafy green vegetables like turnip greens and spinach
                
treatment to stop bleeding
                
if blood loss is causing irondeficiency anemia treatment will depend on the cause of the bleeding for example if you have a bleeding ulcer your doctor may prescribe antibiotics and other medicines to treat the ulcer
                
if a polyp or cancerous tumor in your intestine is causing bleeding you may need surgery to remove the growth
                
if you have heavy menstrual flow your doctor may prescribe birth control pills to help reduce your monthly blood flow in some cases surgery may be advised
                
treatments for severe irondeficiency anemia
                
blood transfusion
                
if your irondeficiency anemia is severe you may get a transfusion of red blood cells a blood transfusion is a safe common procedure in which blood is given to you through an iv line in one of your blood vessels a transfusion requires careful matching of donated blood with the recipients blood
                
a transfusion of red blood cells will treat your anemia right away the red blood cells also give a source of iron that your body can reuse however a blood transfusion is only a shortterm treatment your doctor will need to find and treat the cause of your anemia
                
blood transfusions are usually reserved for people whose anemia puts them at a higher risk for heart problems or other severe health issues
                
for more information go to the health topics blood transfusion article
                
iron therapy
                
if you have severe anemia your doctor may recommend iron therapy for this treatment iron is injected into a muscle or an iv line in one of your blood vessels
                
iv iron therapy presents some safety concerns it must be done in a hospital or clinic by experienced staff iron therapy usually is given to people who need iron longterm but cant take iron supplements by mouth this therapy also is given to people who need immediate treatment for irondeficiency anemia"

exams and tests,how to diagnose inguinal hernia ,"a health care provider diagnoses an inguinal hernia with
                
 a medical and family history   a physical exam   imaging tests including x rays
                
medical and family history taking a medical and family history may help a health care provider diagnose an inguinal hernia often the symptoms that the patient describes will be signs of an inguinal hernia
                
physical exam a physical exam may help diagnose an inguinal hernia during a physical exam a health care provider usually examines the patients body the health care provider may ask the patient to stand and cough or strain so the health care provider can feel for a bulge caused by the hernia as it moves into the groin or scrotum the health care provider may gently try to massage the hernia back into its proper position in the abdomen
                
imaging tests a health care provider does not usually use imaging tests including x rays to diagnose an inguinal hernia unless he or she
                
 is trying to diagnose a strangulation or an incarceration   cannot feel the inguinal hernia during a physical exam especially in patients who are overweight   is uncertain if the hernia or another condition is causing the swelling in the groin or other symptoms
                
specially trained technicians perform imaging tests at a health care providers office an outpatient center or a hospital
                
a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images a patient does not usually need anesthesia
                
tests may include the following
                
 abdominal x ray an x ray is a picture recorded on film or on a computer using a small amount of radiation the patient will lie on a table or stand during the x ray the technician positions the xray machine over the abdominal area the patient will hold his or her breath as the technician takes the picture so that the picture will not be blurry the technician may ask the patient to change position for additional pictures   computerized tomography ct scan ct scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images for a ct scan the technician may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye called contrast medium a health care provider injects the contrast medium into a vein and the injection will make the patient feel warm all over for a minute or two the contrast medium allows the health care provider to see the blood vessels and blood flow on the x rays ct scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnelshaped device where the technician takes the x rays a health care provider may give children a sedative to help them fall asleep for the test   abdominal ultrasound ultrasound uses a device called a transducer that bounces safe painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure"

causes,what causes rotor syndrome ,what causes rotor syndrome rotor syndrome is an inherited disorder caused by having mutations in both the  and  genes these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in liver cells where they transport bilirubin and other substances from the blood into the liver so that they can be cleared from the body in the liver bilirubin is dissolved in a digestive fluid called bile and then excreted from the body the mutations in the  and  genes that cause rotor syndrome either prevent the production of the transporting proteins or prevent them from functioning properly when this occurs bilirubin is not effectively removed from the body and builds up leading to jaundice
prevention,how vaccines prevent disease,why are childhood vaccines so important it is always better to prevent a disease than to treat it after it occurs diseases that used to be common in this country and around the world including polio measles diphtheria pertussis whooping cough rubella german measles mumps tetanus rotavirus and haemophilus influenzae type b hib can now be prevented by vaccination thanks to a vaccine one of the most terrible diseases in history – smallpox – no longer exists outside the laboratory over the years vaccines have prevented countless cases of disease and saved millions of lives immunity protects us from disease immunity is the body’s way of preventing disease  children are born with an immune system composed of cells glands organs and fluids located throughout the body the immune system recognizes germs that enter the body as foreign invaders” called antigens and produces proteins called antibodies to fight them the first time a child is infected with a specific antigen say measles virus the immune system produces antibodies designed to fight it this takes time    usually the immune system can’t work fast enough to prevent the antigen from causing disease so the child still gets sick  however the immune system “remembers” that antigen if it ever enters the body again even after many years the immune system can produce antibodies fast enough to keep it from causing disease a second time this protection is called immunity it would be nice if there were a way to give children immunity to a disease without their having to get sick first in fact there is vaccines contain the same antigens or parts of antigens that cause diseases for example measles vaccine contains measles virus but the antigens in vaccines are either killed or weakened to the point that they don’t cause disease however they are strong enough to make the immune system produce antibodies that lead to immunity in other words a vaccine is a safer substitute for a child’s first exposure to a disease the child gets protection without having to get sick through vaccination children can develop immunity without suffering from the actual diseases that vaccines prevent top of page more facts newborn babies are immune to many diseases because they have antibodies they got from their mothers however this immunity goes away during the first year of life if an unvaccinated child is exposed to a disease germ the childs body may not be strong enough to fight the disease before vaccines many children died from diseases that vaccines now prevent such as whooping cough measles and polio those same germs exist today but because babies are protected by vaccines we don’t see these diseases nearly as often immunizing individual children also helps to protect the health of our community especially those people who cannot be immunized children who are too young to be vaccinated or those who can’t receive certain vaccines for medical reasons and the small proportion of people who don’t respond to a particular vaccine vaccinepreventable diseases have a costly impact resulting in doctors visits hospitalizations and premature deaths sick children can also cause parents to lose time from work   related pages why immunize vaccines a safe choice parents guide to immunizations for parents how vaccines prevent diseases top of page   images and logos on this website which are trademarkedcopyrighted or used with permission of the trademarkcopyright or logo holder are not in the public domain these images and logos have been licensed for or used with permission in the materials provided on this website the materials in the form presented on this website may be used without seeking further permission any other use of trademarkedcopyrighted images or logos requires permission from the trademarkcopyright holdermore this graphic notice means that you are leaving an hhs web site for more information please see the exit notification and disclaimer policy

information,do you have information about orthodontia,summary  some people have naturally straight teeth that fit together but if you have problems with your bite or the spacing of your teeth you may need orthodontic care orthodontia is the branch of dentistry that deals with abnormalities of the teeth and jaw    orthodontic care involves the use of devices such as braces to         straighten teeth      correct problems with bite      close gaps between teeth      align lips and teeth properly        most people who receive orthodontic care are kids but adults get braces too in young children orthodontic treatment may guide proper jaw growth this can help permanent teeth to come in properly straight permanent teeth can help prevent tooth problems later on
information,do you have information about ozone,summary  ozone is a gas it can be good or bad depending on where it is good ozone occurs naturally about  to  miles above the earths surface it shields us from the suns ultraviolet rays part of the good ozone layer is gone manmade chemicals have destroyed it without enough good ozone people may get too much ultraviolet radiation this may increase the risk of skin cancer cataracts and immune system problems    bad ozone is at ground level it forms when pollutants from cars factories and other sources react chemically with sunlight it is the main ingredient in smog it is usually worst in the summer breathing bad ozone can be harmful it can cause coughing throat irritation worsening of asthma bronchitis and emphysema it can lead to permanent lung damage if you are regularly exposed to it    environmental protection agency
causes,what causes trisomy  mosaicism ,what causes trisomy  mosaicism trisomy  mosaicism can arise due to errors in cell division that occur after conception for example at the time of conception the fetus may actually have trisomy  in all of its cells however during cell division some of the cells lose the extra chromosome  alternatively the fetus may initially have had only two copies of chromosome  but due to errors in cell division some of the cells end up with an extra copy of chromosome  either of these two scenarios result in trisomy  mosaicism to read more about trisomy mosaicism visit the following links from the medical genetics department at the university of british columbia in canada what is mosaicism  how does trisomy mosaicism occur
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to pontocerebellar hypoplasia ,pontocerebellar hypoplasia can result from mutations in several genes about half of all cases of  are caused by mutations in the  gene  can also result from mutations in several other genes including   and   is caused by mutations in the    or sepsecs gene in addition to causing  and  mutations in the  gene can cause  and  mutations in the  gene in addition to causing  can result in  the remaining types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia are caused by mutations in other genes in some cases the genetic cause of pontocerebellar hypoplasia is unknown  the genes associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia appear to play essential roles in the development and survival of nerve cells neurons many of these genes are known or suspected to be involved in processing rna molecules which are chemical cousins of dna fully processed mature rna molecules are essential for the normal functioning of all cells including neurons studies suggest that abnormal rna processing likely underlies the abnormal brain development characteristic of pontocerebellar hypoplasia although the exact mechanism is unknown researchers hypothesize that developing neurons in certain areas of the brain may be particularly sensitive to problems with rna processing  some of the genes associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia have functions unrelated to rna processing in most cases it is unclear how mutations in these genes impair brain development
susceptibility,who is at risk for polycythemia vera ,polycythemia vera pv is a rare blood disease the disease affects people of all ages but its most common in adults who are older than  pv is rare in children and young adults men are at slightly higher risk for pv than women
information,what is are linear scleroderma ,linear scleroderma  is one subtype of localized scleroderma most commonly occurring in childhood it is characterized by abnormalities of the skin and subcutaneous tissues that often follow a dermatomal distribution and that are found on one side of the body besides the lesion in the face or scalp there are also abnormalities of the muscles fat tissue and skull when the face is affected some strips located on the forehead may be hollow and lead to an appearance termed en coup de sabre in most cases raynauds phenomenon is absent the exact cause is still unknown but may be related to an autoimmune reaction resulting in too much collagen management is symptomatic and includes immunosupressant medication physical therapy is helpful for the muscle retraction problems
information,what is are dyggvemelchiorclausen syndrome ,dyggvemelchiorclausen dmc syndrome is a rare progressive genetic condition characterized by abnormal skeletal development microcephaly and intellectual disability only about  cases have been reported to date skeletal abnormalities may include a barrelshaped chest with a short truck partial dislocation of the hips knock knees bowlegs and decreased joint mobility a small number of affected individuals experience instability in the upper neck vertebrae that can lead to spinal cord compression weakness and paralysis normally there is growth deficiency resulting in short stature dmc is caused by mutations in the dym gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner some researchers have described an xlinked pattern of inheritance which has not been confirmed to date
treatment,what are the treatments for treatment methods for kidney failure hemodialysis ,"your kidneys do much more than remove wastes and extra fluid they also make hormones and balance chemicals in your system when your kidneys stop working you may have problems with anemia and conditions that affect your bones nerves and skin some of the more common conditions caused by kidney failure are extreme tiredness bone problems joint problems itching and restless legs restless legs will keep you awake as you feel them twitching and jumping
                
anemia and erythropoietin epo
                
anemia is a condition in which the volume of red blood cells is low red blood cells carry oxygen to cells throughout the body without oxygen cells cant use the energy from food so someone with anemia may tire easily and look pale anemia can also contribute to heart problems
                
anemia is common in people with kidney disease because the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin or epo which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells diseased kidneys often dont make enough epo and so the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells epo is available commercially and is commonly given to patients on dialysis
                
for more information about the causes of and treatments for anemia in kidney failure see the niddk fact sheet anemia in chronic kidney disease
                
renal osteodystrophy
                
the term renal describes things related to the kidneys renal osteodystrophy or bone disease of kidney failure affects  percent of dialysis patients it causes bones to become thin and weak or formed incorrectly and affects both children and adults symptoms can be seen in growing children with kidney disease even before they start dialysis older patients and women who have gone through menopause are at greater risk for this disease
                
for more information about the causes of this bone disease and its treatment in dialysis patients see the niddk fact sheet chronic kidney diseasemineral and bone disorder
                
itching pruritus
                
many people treated with hemodialysis complain of itchy skin which is often worse during or just after treatment itching is common even in people who dont have kidney disease in kidney failure however itching can be made worse by wastes in the bloodstream that current dialyzer membranes cant remove from the blood
                
the problem can also be related to high levels of parathyroid hormone pth some people have found dramatic relief after having their parathyroid glands removed the four parathyroid glands sit on the outer surface of the thyroid gland which is located on the windpipe in the base of your neck just above the collarbone the parathyroid glands help control the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood
                
but a cure for itching that works for everyone has not been found phosphate binders seem to help some people these medications act like sponges to soak up or bind phosphorus while it is in the stomach others find relief after exposure to ultraviolet light still others improve with epo shots a few antihistamines benadryl atarax vistaril have been found to help also capsaicin cream applied to the skin may relieve itching by deadening nerve impulses in any case taking care of dry skin is important applying creams with lanolin or camphor may help
                
sleep disorders
                
patients on dialysis often have insomnia and some people have a specific problem called the sleep apnea syndrome which is often signaled by snoring and breaks in snoring episodes of apnea are actually breaks in breathing during sleep over time these sleep disturbances can lead to daynight reversal insomnia at night sleepiness during the day headache depression and decreased alertness the apnea may be related to the effects of advanced kidney failure on the control of breathing treatments that work with people who have sleep apnea whether they have kidney failure or not include losing weight changing sleeping position and wearing a mask that gently pumps air continuously into the nose nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap
                
many people on dialysis have trouble sleeping at night because of aching uncomfortable jittery or restless legs you may feel a strong impulse to kick or thrash your legs kicking may occur during sleep and disturb a bed partner throughout the night the causes of restless legs may include nerve damage or chemical imbalances
                
moderate exercise during the day may help but exercising a few hours before bedtime can make it worse people with restless leg syndrome should reduce or avoid caffeine alcohol and tobacco some people also find relief with massages or warm baths a class of drugs called benzodiazepines often used to treat insomnia or anxiety may help as well these prescription drugs include klonopin librium valium and halcion a newer and sometimes more effective therapy is levodopa sinemet a drug used to treat parkinsons disease
                
sleep disorders may seem unimportant but they can impair your quality of life dont hesitate to raise these problems with your nurse doctor or social worker
                
amyloidosis
                
dialysisrelated amyloidosis dra is common in people who have been on dialysis for more than  years dra develops when proteins in the blood deposit on joints and tendons causing pain stiffness and fluid in the joints as is the case with arthritis working kidneys filter out these proteins but dialysis filters are not as effective for more information see the niddk fact sheet amyloidosis and kidney disease"
inheritance,is waardenburg syndrome inherited ,waardenburg syndrome is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder in most cases an affected person has one parent with the condition a small percentage of cases result from new mutations in the gene these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family  some cases of type ii and type iv waardenburg syndrome appear to have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations most often the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition

treatment,what are the treatments for anal cancer ,"key points
                     there are different types of treatment for patients with anal cancer     three types of standard treatment are used          radiation therapy      chemotherapy      surgery         having the human immunodeficiency virus can affect treatment of anal cancer     new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials           radiosensitizers         patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with anal cancer
                    different types of treatments are available for patients with anal cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    three types of standard treatment are used
                    radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy               external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer        internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat anal cancer       chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated        surgery              local resection a surgical procedure in which the tumor is cut from the anus along with some of the healthy tissue around it local resection may be used if the cancer is small and has not spread this procedure may save the sphincter muscles so the patient can still control bowel movements tumors that form in the lower part of the anus can often be removed with local resection       abdominoperineal resection a surgical procedure in which the anus the rectum and part of the sigmoid colon are removed through an incision made in the abdomen the doctor sews the end of the intestine to an opening called a stoma made in the surface of the abdomen so body waste can be collected in a disposable bag outside of the body this is called a colostomy lymph nodes that contain cancer may also be removed during this operation
                
                
                    having the human immunodeficiency virus can affect treatment of anal cancer
                    cancer therapy can further damage the already weakened immune systems of patients who have the human immunodeficiency virus hiv for this reason patients who have anal cancer and hiv are usually treated with lower doses of anticancer drugs and radiation than patients who do not have hiv
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website     radiosensitizers     radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

inheritance,is proud syndrome inherited ,how is proud syndrome inherited proud syndrome is inherited in an xlinked recessive manner a condition is considered xlinked if the mutated gene that causes the condition is located on the x chromosome one of the two sex chromosomes the y chromosome is the other sex chromosome women have two x chromosomes and men have an x and a y chromosome in xlinked recessive conditions men develop the condition if they inherit one gene mutation they have only one x chromosome females are generally only affected if they have two gene mutations they have two x chromosomes although some females may rarely have a mild form of the condition if they only inherit one mutation a woman with an xlinked recessive condition will pass the mutation on to all of her sons and daughters this means that all of her sons will have the condition and all of her daughters will be carriers a man with an xlinked recessive condition will pass the mutation to all of his daughters carriers and none of his sons
stages,what are the stages of salivary gland cancer ,"key points
                     after salivary gland cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the salivary gland or to other parts of the body      there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body     cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body     the following stages are used for major salivary gland cancers          stage i      stage ii      stage iii      stage iv
                
                
                    after salivary gland cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the salivary gland or to other parts of the body
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the salivary glands or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment the following procedures may be used in the staging process            mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri       ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body
                    cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood          tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas      lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body      blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood          lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body     blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if salivary gland cancer spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually salivary gland cancer cells the disease is metastatic salivary gland cancer not lung cancer
                
                
                    the following stages are used for major salivary gland cancers
                    stage i    in stage i the tumor is in the salivary gland only and is  centimeters or smaller        stage ii    in stage ii the tumor is in the salivary gland only and is larger than  centimeters but not larger than  centimeters       stage iii    in stage iii one of the following is true             the tumor is not larger than  centimeters and has spread to a single lymph node on the same side as the tumor and the lymph node is  centimeters or smaller      the tumor is larger than  centimeters andor has spread to soft tissue around the affected gland cancer may have spread to a single lymph node on the same side as the tumor and the lymph node is  centimeters or smaller              stage iv     stage iv is divided into stages iva ivb and ivc as follows              stage iva                   the tumor may be any size and may have spread to soft tissue around the affected gland cancer has spread to a single lymph node on the same side as the tumor and the lymph node is larger than  centimeters but not larger than  centimeters or has spread to more than one lymph node on either or both sides of the body and the lymph nodes are not larger than  centimeters or        cancer has spread to the skin jawbone ear canal andor facial nerve and may have spread to one or more lymph nodes on either or both sides of the body the lymph nodes are not larger than  centimeters                  stage ivb                   the tumor may be any size and may have spread to soft tissue around the affected gland cancer has spread to a lymph node larger than  centimeters or        cancer has spread to the base of the skull andor the carotid artery and may have spread to one or more lymph nodes of any size on either or both sides of the body                  stage ivc                   the tumor may be any size and may have spread to soft tissue around the affected gland to the skin jawbone ear canal facial nerve base of the skull or carotid artery or to one or more lymph nodes on either or both sides of the body cancer has spread to distant parts of the body                       salivary gland cancers are also grouped by grade the grade of a tumor tells how fast the cancer cells are growing based on how the cells look under a microscope lowgrade cancers grow more slowly than highgrade cancers     minor salivary gland cancers are staged according to where they were first found in the body"

causes,what causes lung cancer ,tobacco products and cancer using tobacco products has been shown to cause cancer in fact smoking tobacco using smokeless tobacco and being exposed regularly to secondhand tobacco smoke are responsible for a large number of cancer deaths in the us each year cigarette smoking causes lung cancer cigarette smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer scientists have reported widely on the link between cancer and smoking since the  since then study after study has provided more proof that cigarette smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer before cigarette smoking became popular after world war i doctors rarely if ever saw patients with lung cancer but today lung cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer over  percent of people with lung cancer developed it because they smoked cigarettes if you smoke if you smoke cigarettes you are at much higher risk for lung cancer than a person who has never smoked the risk of dying from lung cancer is  times higher for men who smoke and  times higher for women who smoke than for people who have never smoked lung cancer can affect young and old alike  stopping smoking greatly reduces your risk for developing lung cancer after you stop your risk levels off ten years after the last cigarette the risk of dying from lung cancer drops by  percent  which does not mean however that risk is eliminated watch the videos on this page to learn more about lung cancer smoking and older adults to enlarge the videos click the brackets in the lower righthand corner of the video screen to reduce the videos press the escape esc button on your keyboard smoking cigars and pipes also puts you at risk for lung cancer cigar and pipe smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer than nonsmokers even cigar and pipe smokers who do not inhale are at increased risk for lung mouth and other types of cancer the likelihood that a smoker will develop lung cancer is related to the age smoking began how long the person smoked the number of cigarettes pipes or cigars smoked per day and how deeply the smoker inhaled  learn about lung cancer prevention other factors that increase your risk  many studies suggest that nonsmokers who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke also called secondhand smoke are at increased risk of lung cancer secondhand smoke is the smoke that nonsmokers are exposed to when they share air space with someone who is smoking tobacco smoke contains more than  chemicals including hundreds that are toxic and about  that can cause cancer since  approximately  nonsmokers have died from health problems caused by exposure to secondhand smoke    exposure to radon can put a person at risk for lung cancer too people who work in mines may be exposed to this invisible odorless and radioactive gas that occurs naturally in soil and rocks it is also found in houses in some parts of the country a kit available at most hardware stores allows homeowners to measure radon levels in their homes    another substance that can contribute to lung cancer is asbestos asbestos has been used in shipbuilding asbestos mining and manufacturing insulation work and brake repair although products with asbestos have been largely phased out over the past several decades if inhaled asbestos particles can lodge in the lungs damaging cells and increasing the risk for lung cancer  many studies suggest that nonsmokers who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke also called secondhand smoke are at increased risk of lung cancer secondhand smoke is the smoke that nonsmokers are

exams and tests,how to diagnose urine blockage in newborns ,"defects of the urinary tract may be diagnosed before or after the baby is born
                
diagnosis before birth
                
tests during pregnancy can help determine if the baby is developing normally in the womb
                
 ultrasound ultrasound uses a device called a transducer that bounces safe painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure a prenatal ultrasound can show internal organs within the baby the procedure is performed in a health care providers office outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician and the images are interpreted by      a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging or     an obstetriciana doctor who delivers babies
                
the images can show enlarged kidneys ureters or bladders in babies
                
 amniocentesis amniocentesis is a procedure in which amniotic fluid is removed from the mothers womb for testing the procedure can be performed in the health care providers office and local anesthetic may be used the health care provider inserts a thin needle through the abdomen into the uterus to obtain a small amount of amniotic fluid cells from the fluid are grown in a lab and then analyzed the health care provider usually uses ultrasound to find the exact location of the baby the test can show whether the baby has certain birth defects and how well the babys lungs are developing   chorionic villus sampling cvs cvs is the removal of a small piece of tissue from the placenta for testing the procedure can be performed in the health care providers office anesthesia is not needed the health care provider uses ultrasound to guide a thin tube or needle through the vagina or abdomen into the placenta cells are removed from the placenta and then analyzed the test can show whether the baby has certain genetic defects
                
most healthy women do not need all of these tests ultrasound exams during pregnancy are routine amniocentesis and cvs are recommended only when a risk of genetic problems exists because of family history or a problem is detected during an ultrasound amniocentesis and cvs carry a slight risk of harming the baby and mother or ending the pregnancy in miscarriage so the risks should be carefully considered
                
diagnosis after birth
                
different imaging techniques can be used in infants and children to determine the cause of urine blockage
                
 ultrasound ultrasound can be used to view the childs urinary tract for infants the image is clearer than could be achieved while the baby was in the womb   voiding cystourethrogram vcug vcug is an xray image of the bladder and urethra taken while the bladder is full and during urination also called voiding the procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an xray technician supervised by a radiologist who then interprets the images while anesthesia is not needed sedation may be used for some children the bladder and urethra are filled with a special dye called contrast medium to make the structures clearly visible on the xray images the xray machine captures images of the contrast medium while the bladder is full and when the child urinates the test can show reflux or blockage of the bladder due to an obstruction such as puv   radionuclide scan a radionuclide scan is an imaging technique that detects small amounts of radiation after a person is injected with radioactive chemicals the dose of the radioactive chemicals is small therefore the risk of causing damage to cells is low radionuclide scans are performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician and the images are interpreted by a radiologist anesthesia is not needed special cameras and computers are used to create images of the radioactive chemicals as they pass through the kidneys radioactive chemicals injected into the blood can provide information about kidney function"

symptoms,what are the symptoms of prostate enlargement benign prostatic hyperplasia ,"lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia may include
                
 urinary frequencyurination eight or more times a day   urinary urgencythe inability to delay urination   trouble starting a urine stream   a weak or an interrupted urine stream   dribbling at the end of urination   nocturiafrequent urination during periods of sleep   urinary retention   urinary incontinencethe accidental loss of urine   pain after ejaculation or during urination   urine that has an unusual color or smell
                
symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia most often come from
                
 a blocked urethra   a bladder that is overworked from trying to pass urine through the blockage
                
the size of the prostate does not always determine the severity of the blockage or symptoms some men with greatly enlarged prostates have little blockage and few symptoms while other men who have minimally enlarged prostates have greater blockage and more symptoms less than half of all men with benign prostatic hyperplasia have lower urinary tract 
                
sometimes men may not know they have a blockage until they cannot urinate this condition called acute urinary retention can result from taking overthecounter cold or allergy medications that contain decongestants such as pseudoephedrine and oxymetazoline a potential side effect of these medications may prevent the bladder neck from relaxing and releasing urine medications that contain antihistamines such as diphenhydramine can weaken the contraction of bladder muscles and cause urinary retention difficulty urinating and painful urination when men have partial urethra blockage urinary retention also can occur as a result of alcohol consumption cold temperatures or a long period of inactivity"

information,what is are familial esophageal achalasia ,familial esophageal achalasia refers to a cluster of achalasia within a family achalasia is a condition that affects the esophagus the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach in people with achalasia the normal muscle activity of the esophagus is reduced and the muscular valve where the esophagus and the stomach meet doesnt fully relax this makes it difficult for food to move from the esophagus to the stomach as a result people with achalasia may experience regurgitation of food chest pain cough difficulty swallowing heartburn andor unintentional weight loss reports of familial esophageal achalasia are rare and represent less than  of all achalasia cases in these families the underlying genetic cause of the condition is unknown but it appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner treatment aims to allow food to pass more easily into this stomach and may include injections with botulinum toxin botox certain medications andor surgery
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to dolkcongenital disorder of glycosylation ,dolkcdg is caused by mutations in the dolk gene this gene provides instructions for making the enzyme dolichol kinase which facilitates the final step of the production of a compound called dolichol phosphate this compound is critical for a process called glycosylation which attaches groups of sugar molecules oligosaccharides to proteins glycosylation changes proteins in ways that are important for their functions during glycosylation sugars are added to dolichol phosphate in order to build the oligosaccharide chain once the chain is formed dolichol phosphate transports the oligosaccharide to the protein that needs to be glycosylated and attaches it to a specific site on the protein  mutations in the dolk gene lead to the production of abnormal dolichol kinase with reduced or absent activity without properly functioning dolichol kinase dolichol phosphate is not produced and glycosylation cannot proceed normally in particular a protein known to stabilize heart muscle fibers called alphadystroglycan has been shown to have reduced glycosylation in people with dolkcdg impaired glycosylation of alphadystroglycan disrupts its normal function which damages heart muscle fibers as they repeatedly contract and relax over time the fibers weaken and break down leading to dilated cardiomyopathy the other signs and symptoms of dolkcdg are likely due to the abnormal glycosylation of additional proteins in other organs and tissues

causes,what causes kidney stones in children ,"kidney stones can form when substances in the urinesuch as calcium magnesium oxalate and phosphorousbecome highly concentrated due to one or more causes
                
 defects in the urinary tract may block the flow of urine and create pools of urine in stagnant urine stoneforming substances tend to settle together into stones up to onethird of children who have stones have an anatomic abnormality in their urinary tract   kidney stones may have a genetic cause in other words the tendency to form stones can run in families due to inherited factors   an unhealthy lifestyle may make children more likely to have kidney stones for example drinking too little water or drinking the wrong types of fluids such as soft drinks or drinks with caffeine may cause substances in the urine to become too concentrated similarly too much sodium or salt in the diet may contribute to more chemicals in the urine causing an increase in stone formation some doctors believe increases in obesity rates less active lifestyles and diets higher in salt may be causing more children to have kidney stones   sometimes a urinary tract infection can cause kidney stones to form some types of bacteria in the urinary tract break down ureaa waste product removed from the blood by the kidneysinto substances that form stones   some children have metabolic disorders that lead to kidney stones metabolism is the way the body uses digested food for energy including the process of breaking down food using foods nutrients in the body and removing the wastes that remain the most common metabolic disorder that causes kidney stones in children is hypercalciuria which causes extra calcium to collect in the urine other more rare metabolic conditions involve problems breaking down oxalate a substance made in the body and found in some foods these conditions include hyperoxaluria too much oxalate in the urine and oxalosis characterized by deposits of oxalate and calcium in the bodys tissues another rare metabolic condition called cystinuria can cause kidney stones cystinuria is an excess of the amino acid cystine in the urine amino acids are the building blocks of proteins"

treatment,what are the treatments for gas in the digestive tract ,"gas can be treated by reducing swallowed air making dietary changes or taking overthecounter or prescription medications people who think they have too much gas can try to treat gas on their own before seeing a health care provider health care providers can provide advice about reducing gas and prescribe medications that may help
                
reducing swallowed air swallowing less air may help reduce gas especially for people who burp frequently a health care provider may suggest eating more slowly avoiding gum and hard candies or checking with a dentist to make sure dentures fit correctly
                
making dietary changes people may be able to reduce gas by eating less of the foods that cause gas however many healthy foods may cause gas such as fruits and vegetables whole grains and milk products the amount of gas caused by certain foods varies from person to person effective dietary changes depend on learning through trial and error which foods cause a person to have gas and how much of the offending foods one can handle
                
while fat does not cause gas limiting highfat foods can help reduce bloating and discomfort less fat in the diet helps the stomach empty faster allowing gases to move more quickly into the small intestine
                
taking overthecounter medications some overthecounter medications can help reduce gas or the symptoms associated with gas
                
 alphagalactosidase beano an overthecounter digestive aid contains the sugardigesting enzyme that the body lacks to digest the sugar in beans and many vegetables the enzyme comes in liquid and tablet form five drops are added per serving or one tablet is swallowed just before eating to break down the gasproducing sugars beano has no effect on gas caused by lactose or fiber   simethicone gasx mylanta gas can relieve bloating and abdominal pain or discomfort caused by gas   lactase tablets or drops can help people with lactose intolerance digest milk and milk products to reduce gas lactase tablets are taken just before eating foods that contain lactose lactase drops can be added to liquid milk products lactosefree and lactosereduced milk and milk products are available at most grocery stores

information,what is are very longchain acylcoa dehydrogenase deficiency ,very longchain acylcoa dehydrogenase vlcad deficiency is a condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy particularly during periods without food fasting  signs and symptoms of vlcad deficiency typically appear during infancy or early childhood and can include low blood sugar hypoglycemia lack of energy lethargy and muscle weakness affected individuals are also at risk for serious complications such as liver abnormalities and lifethreatening heart problems when symptoms begin in adolescence or adulthood they tend to be milder and usually do not involve the heart  problems related to vlcad deficiency can be triggered by periods of fasting illness and exercise this disorder is sometimes mistaken for reye syndrome a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu most cases of reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections
information,what is are duchenne and becker muscular dystrophy ,muscular dystrophies are a group of genetic conditions characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting atrophy the duchenne and becker types of muscular dystrophy are two related conditions that primarily affect skeletal muscles which are used for movement and heart cardiac muscle these forms of muscular dystrophy occur almost exclusively in males  duchenne and becker muscular dystrophies have similar signs and symptoms and are caused by different mutations in the same gene the two conditions differ in their severity age of onset and rate of progression in boys with duchenne muscular dystrophy muscle weakness tends to appear in early childhood and worsen rapidly affected children may have delayed motor skills such as sitting standing and walking they are usually wheelchairdependent by adolescence the signs and symptoms of becker muscular dystrophy are usually milder and more varied in most cases muscle weakness becomes apparent later in childhood or in adolescence and worsens at a much slower rate  both the duchenne and becker forms of muscular dystrophy are associated with a heart condition called cardiomyopathy this form of heart disease weakens the cardiac muscle preventing the heart from pumping blood efficiently in both duchenne and becker muscular dystrophy cardiomyopathy typically begins in adolescence later the heart muscle becomes enlarged and the heart problems develop into a condition known as dilated cardiomyopathy signs and symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy can include an irregular heartbeat arrhythmia shortness of breath extreme tiredness fatigue and swelling of the legs and feet these heart problems worsen rapidly and become lifethreatening in many cases males with duchenne muscular dystrophy typically live into their twenties while males with becker muscular dystrophy can survive into their forties or beyond  a related condition called dmdassociated dilated cardiomyopathy is a form of heart disease caused by mutations in the same gene as duchenne and becker muscular dystrophy and it is sometimes classified as subclinical becker muscular dystrophy people with dmdassociated dilated cardiomyopathy typically do not have any skeletal muscle weakness or wasting although they may have subtle changes in their skeletal muscle cells that are detectable through laboratory testing
inheritance,is carnitineacylcarnitine translocase deficiency inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition
treatment,what are the treatments for tetralogy of fallot ,"tetralogy of fallot is repaired with openheart surgery either soon after birth or later in infancy the goal of surgery is to repair the four defects of tetralogy of fallot so the heart can work as normally as possible repairing the defects can greatly improve a childs health and quality of life
                
the pediatric cardiologist and cardiac surgeon will decide the best time to do the surgery they will base their decision on your babys health and weight and the severity of the defects and symptoms
                
some teenagers or adults who had tetralogy of fallot repaired in childhood need additional surgery to correct heart problems that develop over time for more information go to living with tetralogy of fallot
                
types of surgery
                
complete intracardiac repair
                
surgery to repair tetralogy of fallot improves blood flow to the lungs surgery also ensures that oxygenrich and oxygenpoor blood flow to the right places
                
the surgeon will
                
widen the narrowed pulmonary blood vessels the pulmonary valve is widened or replaced also the passage from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery is enlarged these procedures improve blood flow to the lungs this allows the blood to get enough oxygen to meet the bodys needs
                
repair the ventricular septal defect vsd a patch is used to cover the hole in the septum this patch stops oxygenrich and oxygenpoor blood from mixing between the ventricles
                
fixing these two defects resolves problems caused by the other two defects when the right ventricle no longer has to work so hard to pump blood to the lungs it will return to a normal thickness fixing the vsd means that only oxygenrich blood will flow out of the left ventricle into the aorta
                
the incision cut that the surgeon makes to reach the heart usually heals in about  the surgeon or a hospital staff member will explain when its okay to give your baby a bath pick him or her up under the arms and take your baby for regular shots immunizations
                
temporary or palliative surgery
                
it was common in the past to do temporary surgery during infancy for tetralogy of fallot this surgery improved blood flow to the lungs a complete repair of the four defects was done later in childhood
                
now tetralogy of fallot usually is fully repaired in infancy however some babies are too weak or too small to have the full repair they must have temporary surgery first this surgery improves oxygen levels in the blood the surgery also gives the baby time to grow and get strong enough for the full repair
                
for temporary surgery the surgeon places a tube between a large artery branching off the aorta and the pulmonary artery the tube is called a shunt one end of the shunt is sewn to the artery branching off the aorta the other end is sewn to the pulmonary artery
                
the shunt creates an additional pathway for blood to travel to the lungs to get oxygen the surgeon removes the shunt when the babys heart defects are fixed during the full repair
                
after temporary surgery your baby may need medicines to keep the shunt open while waiting for the full repair these medicines are stopped after the surgeon removes the shunt"

feel short of breath
                
have unusual sweating
                
your doctor may have already told you that your palpitations are harmless even so see your doctor again if your palpitations
                
start to occur more often or are more noticeable or bothersome
                
occur with other symptoms such as those listed above
                
your doctor will want to check whether your palpitations are the symptom of a heart problem such as an arrhythmia irregular heartbeat"
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to persistent mllerian duct syndrome ,most people with persistent mllerian duct syndrome have mutations in the amh gene or the  gene the amh gene provides instructions for making a protein called antimllerian hormone amh the  gene provides instructions for making a protein called amh receptor type   the amh protein and amh receptor type  protein are involved in male sex differentiation all fetuses develop the mllerian duct the precursor to female reproductive organs during development of a male fetus these two proteins work together to induce breakdown regression of the mllerian duct mutations in the amh and  genes lead to nonfunctional proteins that cannot signal for regression of the mllerian duct as a result of these mutations the mllerian duct persists and goes on to form a uterus and fallopian tubes  approximately  percent of cases of persistent mllerian duct syndrome are caused by mutations in the amh gene and are called persistent mllerian duct syndrome type  approximately  percent of cases are caused by mutations in the  gene and are called persistent mllerian duct syndrome type  in the remaining  percent of cases no mutations in the amh and  genes have been identified and the genes involved in causing the condition are unknown

when breathing is impaired your lungs cant easily move oxygen into your blood and remove carbon dioxide from your blood gas exchange this can cause a low oxygen level or high carbon dioxide level or both in your blood
                
respiratory failure can occur as a result of
                
conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing examples include muscular dystrophy amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als spinal cord injuries and stroke
                
damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs an injury to the chest can cause this damage
                
problems with the spine such as scoliosis a curve in the spine this condition can affect the bones and muscles used for breathing
                
drug or alcohol overdose an overdose affects the area of the brain that controls breathing during an overdose breathing becomes slow and shallow
                
lung diseases and conditions such as copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pneumonia ards acute respiratory distress syndrome pulmonary embolism and cystic fibrosis these diseases and conditions can affect the flow of air and blood into and out of your lungs ards and pneumonia affect gas exchange in the air sacs

information,what is are familial restrictive cardiomyopathy ,familial restrictive cardiomyopathy is a genetic form of heart disease for the heart to beat normally the heart cardiac muscle must contract and relax in a coordinated way oxygenrich blood from the lungs travels first through the upper chambers of the heart the atria and then to the lower chambers of the heart the ventricles  in people with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy the heart muscle is stiff and cannot fully relax after each contraction impaired muscle relaxation causes blood to back up in the atria and lungs which reduces the amount of blood in the ventricles  familial restrictive cardiomyopathy can appear anytime from childhood to adulthood the first signs and symptoms of this condition in children are failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate failure to thrive extreme tiredness fatigue and fainting children who are severely affected may also have abnormal swelling or puffiness edema increased blood pressure an enlarged liver an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity ascites and lung congestion some children with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy do not have any obvious signs or symptoms but they may die suddenly due to heart failure without treatment the majority of affected children survive only a few years after they are diagnosed  adults with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy typically first develop shortness of breath fatigue and a reduced ability to exercise some individuals have an irregular heart beat arrhythmia and may also experience a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest palpitations and dizziness abnormal blood clots are commonly seen in adults with this condition without treatment approximately onethird of adults with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy do not survive more than five years after diagnosis
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to frontotemporal dementia with  , is caused by mutations in the mapt gene this gene is located on chromosome  which is how the disease got its name  the mapt gene provides instructions for making a protein called tau this protein is found throughout the nervous system including in nerve cells neurons in the brain it is involved in assembling and stabilizing microtubules which are rigid hollow fibers that make up the cells structural framework the cytoskeleton microtubules help cells maintain their shape assist in the process of cell division and are essential for the transport of materials within cells  mutations in the mapt gene disrupt the normal structure and function of tau the defective protein assembles into abnormal clumps within neurons and other brain cells however it is unclear what effect these clumps have on cell function and survival  is characterized by the gradual death of cells in areas of the brain called the frontal and temporal lobes the frontal lobes are involved in reasoning planning judgment and problemsolving while the temporal lobes help process hearing speech memory and emotion a loss of cells in these brain regions leads to personality changes speech difficulties and the other features of    is one of several related diseases known as tauopathies which are characterized by an abnormal buildup of tau in the brain

information,what is are abdominal wall defect ,an abdominal wall defect is an opening in the abdomen through which various abdominal organs can protrude this opening varies in size and can usually be diagnosed early in fetal development typically between the tenth and fourteenth weeks of pregnancy there are two main types of abdominal wall defects omphalocele and gastroschisis omphalocele is an opening in the center of the abdominal wall where the umbilical cord meets the abdomen organs typically the intestines stomach and liver protrude through the opening into the umbilical cord and are covered by the same protective membrane that covers the umbilical cord gastroschisis is a defect in the abdominal wall usually to the right of the umbilical cord through which the large and small intestines protrude although other organs may sometimes bulge out there is no membrane covering the exposed organs in gastroschisis  fetuses with omphalocele may grow slowly before birth intrauterine growth retardation and they may be born prematurely individuals with omphalocele frequently have multiple birth defects such as a congenital heart defect additionally underdevelopment of the lungs is often associated with omphalocele because the abdominal organs normally provide a framework for chest wall growth when those organs are misplaced the chest wall does not form properly providing a smaller than normal space for the lungs to develop as a result many infants with omphalocele have respiratory insufficiency and may need to be supported with a machine to help them breathe mechanical ventilation rarely affected individuals who have breathing problems in infancy experience recurrent lung infections or asthma later in life affected infants often have gastrointestinal problems including a backflow of stomach acids into the esophagus gastroesophageal reflux and feeding difficulty these problems can persist even after treatment of omphalocele large omphaloceles or those associated with multiple additional health problems are more often associated with fetal death than cases in which omphalocele occurs alone isolated  omphalocele is a feature of many genetic syndromes nearly half of individuals with omphalocele have a condition caused by an extra copy of one of the chromosomes in each of their cells trisomy up to onethird of people born with omphalocele have a genetic condition called beckwithwiedemann syndrome affected individuals may have additional signs and symptoms associated with these genetic conditions  individuals who have gastroschisis rarely have other birth defects and seldom have chromosome abnormalities or a genetic condition most affected individuals experience intrauterine growth retardation and are small at birth many affected infants are born prematurely  with gastroschisis the protruding organs are not covered by a protective membrane and are susceptible to damage due to direct contact with amniotic fluid in the womb components of the amniotic fluid may trigger immune responses and inflammatory reactions against the intestines that can damage the tissue constriction around exposed organs at the abdominal wall opening late in fetal development may also contribute to organ injury intestinal damage causes impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract peristalsis in most children with gastroschisis in these individuals peristalsis usually improves in a few months and intestinal muscle contractions normalize rarely children with gastroschisis have a narrowing or absence of a portion of intestine intestinal atresia or twisting of the intestine after birth these intestinal malformations can lead to problems with digestive function further loss of intestinal tissue and a condition called short bowel syndrome that occurs when areas of the small intestine are missing causing dehydration and poor absorption of nutrients depending on the severity of the condition intravenous feedings parenteral nutrition may be required  the health of an individual with gastroschisis depends largely on how damaged his or her intestine was before birth when the abdominal wall defect is repaired and normal intestinal function is recovered the vast majority of affected individuals have no health problems related to the repaired defect later in life
exams and tests,how is botulism diagnosed,physicians may consider the diagnosis if the patients history and physical examination suggest botulism however these clues are usually not enough to allow a diagnosis of botulism other diseases such as guillainbarré syndrome stroke and myasthenia gravis can appear similar to botulism and special tests may be needed to exclude these other conditions these tests may include a brain scan spinal fluid examination nerve conduction test electromyography or emg and a tensilon test for myasthenia gravis tests for botulinum toxin and for bacteria that cause botulism can be performed at some state health department laboratories and at cdc
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to biotinthiamineresponsive basal ganglia disease ,biotinthiamineresponsive basal ganglia disease is caused by mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein called a thiamine transporter which moves thiamine into cells thiamine also known as vitamin  is obtained from the diet and is necessary for proper functioning of the nervous system  mutations in the  gene likely result in a protein with impaired ability to transport thiamine into cells resulting in decreased absorption of the vitamin and leading to neurological dysfunction in this disorder abnormalities affect several parts of the brain using medical imaging generalized swelling as well as specific areas of damage lesions in the brain can often be seen including in the basal ganglia the relationship between these specific brain abnormalities and the abnormal thiamine transporter is unknown  it is unclear how biotin is related to this disorder some researchers suggest that the excess biotin given along with thiamine as treatment for the disorder may increase the amount of thiamine transporter that is produced partially compensating for the impaired efficiency of the abnormal protein others propose that biotin transporter proteins may interact with thiamine transporters in such a way that biotin levels influence the course of the disease
information,do you have information about assisted reproductive technology,summary  assisted reproductive technology art is used to treat infertility it includes fertility treatments that handle both a womans egg and a mans sperm it works by removing eggs from a womans body the eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos the embryos are then put back in the womans body in vitro fertilization ivf is the most common and effective type of art     art procedures sometimes use donor eggs donor sperm or previously frozen embryos it may also involve a surrogate or gestational carrier a surrogate is a woman who becomes pregnant with sperm from the male partner of the couple a gestational carrier becomes pregnant with an egg from the female partner and the sperm from the male partner     the most common complication of art is a multiple pregnancy it can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are put into the womans body

exams and tests,how to diagnose cyclic vomiting syndrome ,"a specific test to diagnose cyclic vomiting syndrome does not exist instead a health care provider will rule out other conditions and diagnose the syndrome based upon
                
 a medical and family history   a physical exam   a pattern or cycle of symptoms   blood tests   urine tests   imaging tests   upper gi endoscopy   a gastric emptying test
                
often it is suspected that one of the following is causing their symptoms
                
 gastroparesisa disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine   gastroenteritisinflammation of the lining of the stomach small intestine and large intestine
                
a diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome may be difficult to make until the person sees a health care provider a health care provider will suspect cyclic vomiting syndrome if the person suffers from repeat episodes of vomiting
                
medical and family history
                
taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose cyclic vomiting syndrome he or she will ask the patient to provide a medical and family history
                
physical exam
                
a physical exam may help diagnose other conditions besides cyclic vomiting syndrome during a physical exam a health care provider usually
                
 examines a patients body   taps on specific areas of the patients body
                
pattern or cycle of symptoms in 
                
a health care provider will often suspect cyclic vomiting syndrome in a child when the child
                
 has at least five separate episodes or at least three separate episodes over  months   has episodes of intense nausea and vomiting lasting  hour to  days and occurring at least  week apart   has episodes that are similar to previous onesthey tend to start at the same time of day last the same length of time and occur with the same symptoms and level of intensity   vomits during episodes at least four times per hour for at least  hour   vomits and it is not attributed to another disorder   has absence of nausea and vomiting between episodes
                
pattern or cycle of symptoms in 
                
a health care provider will often suspect cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults when the following is present for at least  months and the symptoms started more than  months ago
                
 each episode of cyclic vomiting syndrome is usually similar to previous ones meaning that episodes tend to start at the same time of day and last the same length of timeless than  week   three or more separate episodes in the past year   absence of nausea or vomiting between episodes
                
blood tests
                
a nurse or technician will draw blood samples at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and send the samples to a lab for analysis the blood test can tell the health care provider if the patient has any signs of dehydration or other problems
                
urine tests
                
urinalysis involves testing a urine sample the patient collects a urine sample in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility a health care provider tests the sample in the same location or sends the sample to a lab for analysis a urinalysis can rule out kidney problems or an infection
                
imaging tests
                
the health care provider decides which test to order based on the symptoms medical history and physical exam
                
upper gi series a health care provider may order an upper gi series to look at the upper gi tract a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imagingperforms this test at a hospital or an outpatient center this test does not require anesthesia the patient should not eat or drink for  hours before the procedure if possible during the procedure the patient will stand or sit in front of an xray machine and drink barium a chalky liquid infants lie on a table and a health care provider gives them barium through a tiny tube placed in the nose that runs into the stomach barium coats the gi tract making signs of obstruction or other problems that can cause vomiting show up more clearly on x rays a patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test the upper gi series can show other problems that may be causing symptoms such as an ulcer or obstruction
                
abdominal ultrasound a health care provider may order an ultrasound to look at the organs in the abdomen a technician uses a device called a transducer that bounces safe painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure the technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office an outpatient center or a hospital a radiologist interprets the images a patient does not need anesthesia the abdominal ultrasound can show other problems that may be causing symptoms such as gallstones
                
upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
                
this procedure involves using an endoscopea small flexible tube with a lightto see the upper gi tract a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center a health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patients throat a nurse or technician will place an iv needle in a vein in the arm to administer sedation or anesthesia sedatives or anesthesia help a patient stay relaxed and comfortable the gastroenterologist carefully inserts the endoscope into the mouth and feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum a small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor allowing close examination of the intestinal lining the upper gi endoscopy can show other problems that may be causing symptoms such as an ulcer a gastroenterologist may obtain a biopsya procedure that involves taking a small piece of tissue for examination with a microscopeof the smallintestinal lining during an upper gi endoscopy the patient will not feel the biopsy
                
gastric emptying test
                
also called gastric emptying scintigraphy this test involves eating a bland mealsuch as eggs or an egg substitutethat contains a small amount of radioactive material a specially trained technician performs the test in a radiology center or hospital and a radiologist interprets the results the patient does not need anesthesia an external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located the radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at    and  hours after the meal"

exams and tests,how to diagnose hypothyroidism ,"many symptoms of hypothyroidism are the same as those of other diseases so hypothyroidism usually cannot be diagnosed based on symptoms alone with suspected hypothyroidism health care providers take a medical history and perform a thorough physical examination health care providers may then use several blood tests to confirm a diagnosis of hypothyroidism and find its cause
                
tsh test the ultrasensitive tsh test is usually the first test a health care provider performs this test detects even tiny amounts of tsh in the blood and is the most accurate measure of thyroid activity available generally a tsh reading above normal means a person has hypothyroidism and a reading below normal means a person has hyperthyroidism
                
mildly elevated tsh without symptoms indicates subclinical hypothyroidism some health care providers treat subclinical hypothyroidism immediately others prefer to leave it untreated but monitor their patients for signs that the condition is worsening
                
health care providers may conduct additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis or determine the cause of hypothyroidism
                
 test this test measures the actual amount of circulating thyroid hormone in the blood in hypothyroidism the level of  in the blood is lower than normal
                
thyroid autoantibody test this test looks for the presence of thyroid autoantibodies most people with hashimotos disease have these antibodies but people whose hypothyroidism is caused by other conditions do not

prevention,how to prevent marburg hemorrhagic fever marburg hf ,"preventive measures against marburg virus infection are not well defined as transmission from wildlife to humans remains an area of ongoing research however avoiding fruit bats and sick nonhuman primates in central africa is one way to protect against infection 
 
measures for prevention of secondary or persontoperson transmission are similar to those used for other hemorrhagic fevers if a patient is either suspected or confirmed to have marburg hemorrhagic fever barrier nursing techniques should be used to prevent direct physical contact with the patient these precautions include wearing of protective gowns gloves and masks placing the infected individual in strict isolation and sterilization or proper disposal of needles equipment and patient excretions 
 
in conjunction with the world health organization cdc has developed practical hospitalbased guidelines titled infection control for viral haemorrhagic fevers in the african health care setting the manual can help healthcare facilities recognize cases and prevent further hospitalbased disease transmission using locally available materials and few financial resources 
 
marburg hemorrhagic fever is a very rare human disease however when it occurs it has the potential to spread to other people especially health care staff and family members who care for the patient therefore increasing awareness in communities and among healthcare providers of the clinical symptoms of patients with marburg hemorrhagic fever is critical better awareness can lead to earlier and stronger precautions against the spread of marburg virus in both family members and healthcare providers improving the use of diagnostic tools is another priority with modern means of transportation that give access even to remote areas it is possible to obtain rapid testing of samples in disease control centers equipped with biosafety level  laboratories in order to confirm or rule out marburg virus infection"

                     there are different types of treatment for patients with retinoblastoma      children with retinoblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children     treatment for retinoblastoma may cause side effects     six types of standard treatment are used          cryotherapy      thermotherapy      chemotherapy       radiation therapy      highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue      surgery enucleation          new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials     patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with retinoblastoma
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with retinoblastoma some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment    because cancer in children is rare taking part in a clinical trial should be considered some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    children with retinoblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children
                    the goals of treatment are to save the childs life to save vision and the eye and to prevent serious side effects treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer the pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with eye cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine these may include a pediatric ophthalmologist childrens eye doctor who has a lot of experience in treating retinoblastoma and the following specialists           pediatric surgeon      radiation oncologist      pediatrician      pediatric nurse specialist      rehabilitation specialist      social worker      geneticist or genetic counselor
                
                
                    treatment for retinoblastoma may cause side effects
                    for information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer see our side effects page   side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects late effects of treatment for retinoblastoma may include the following           physical problems such as seeing or hearing problems or if the eye is removed a change in the shape and size of the bone around the eye      changes in mood feelings thinking learning or memory       second cancers new types of cancer such as lung and bladder cancers osteosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma or melanoma         the following risk factors may increase the risk of having another cancer          having the heritable form of retinoblastoma     past treatment with radiation therapy especially before age  year     having already had a previous second cancer        it is important to talk with your childs doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child regular followup by health professionals who are experts in diagnosing and treating late effects is important see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information
                
                
                    six types of standard treatment are used
                    cryotherapy     cryotherapy is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue this type of treatment is also called cryosurgery       thermotherapy     thermotherapy is the use of heat to destroy cancer cells thermotherapy may be given using a laser beam aimed through the dilated pupil or onto the outside of the eyeball thermotherapy may be used alone for small tumors or combined with chemotherapy for larger tumors this treatment is a type of laser therapy       chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the stage of the cancer and where the cancer is in the body    there are different types of chemotherapy              systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumor chemoreduction and avoid surgery to remove the eye after chemoreduction other treatments may include radiation therapy cryotherapy laser therapy or regional chemotherapy  systemic chemotherapy may also be given to kill any cancer cells that are left after the initial treatment or to patients with retinoblastoma that occurs outside the eye treatment given after the initial treatment to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy      regional chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid intrathecal chemotherapy an organ such as the eye or a body cavity the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas several types of regional chemotherapy are used to treat retinoblastoma                    ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy carries anticancer drugs directly to the eye a catheter is put into an artery that leads to the eye and the anticancer drug is given through the catheter after the drug is given a small balloon may be inserted into the artery to block it and keep most of the anticancer drug trapped near the tumor this type of chemotherapy may be given as the initial treatment when the tumor is in the eye only or when the tumor has not responded to other types of treatment ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy is given at special retinoblastoma treatment centers          intravitreal chemotherapy intravitreal chemotherapy is the injection of anticancer drugs directly into the vitreous humor jellylike substance inside in the eye it is used to treat cancer that has spread to the vitreous humor and has not responded to treatment or has come back after treatment                       see drugs approved for retinoblastoma for more information       radiation therapy    radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy               externalbeam radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue these types of radiation therapy include the following                    intensitymodulated radiation therapy imrt imrt is a type of   external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor thin beams of radiation of different intensities strengths are aimed at the tumor from many angles         protonbeam radiation therapy protonbeam therapy is a type of highenergy external radiation therapy a radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons tiny invisible positivelycharged particles at the cancer cells to kill them                  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue this type of internal radiation therapy may include the following                    plaque radiotherapy radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk called a plaque and placed directly on the outside wall of the eye near the tumor the side of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball aiming radiation at the tumor the plaque helps protect other nearby tissue from the radiation                      the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated and how the cancer responded to other treatments external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat retinoblastoma       highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue     highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored after the chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the bodys blood cells    see drugs approved for retinoblastoma for more information       surgery enucleation      enucleation is surgery to remove the eye and part of the optic nerve a sample of the eye tissue that is removed will be checked under a microscope to see if there are any signs that the cancer is likely to spread to other parts of the body this should be done by an experienced pathologist who is familiar with retinoblastoma and other diseases of the eye enucleation is done if there is little or no chance that vision can be saved and when the tumor is large did not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment the patient will be fitted for an artificial eye    close followup is needed for  years or more to check for signs of recurrence in the area around the affected eye and to check the other eye
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    information about clinical trials is available from the nci website
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your childs condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

prevention,how to prevent parasites  baylisascaris infection ,"baylisascaris infection can be prevented by avoiding contact with raccoons and their feces washing your hands after working or playing outdoors is good practice for preventing a number of diseases
    
do not keep feed or adopt wild animals including raccoons as pets infection rarely causes symptoms in raccoons so you cannot tell if a raccoon is infected by observing its behavior roundworm eggs passed in the feces of infected raccoons are not visible to the naked eye eggs can only be seen using a microscope
    
     
    
    
you may discourage raccoons from living in and around your home or parks by taking these steps
    
      prevent access to food
      keep trash containers tightly closed
      close off access to attics and basements
      keep sandboxes covered when not in use raccoons may use sandboxes as a latrine
      remove fish ponds  they eat the fish and drink the water
      eliminate water sources
      remove bird feeders
      clear brush so raccoons are not likely to make a den on your property
    
    
stay away from areas and materials that might be contaminated by raccoon feces raccoons typically defecate at the base of or in raised forks of trees or on raised horizontal surfaces such as fallen logs stumps or large rocks raccoon feces also can be found on woodpiles decks rooftops and in attics garages and haylofts feces usually are dark and tubular have a pungent odor usually worse than dog or cat feces and often contain undigested seeds or other food items
    
if you have found a raccoon latrine near your home cleaning the area may prevent possible infection newly deposited eggs take at least  weeks to become infective prompt removal and destruction of raccoon feces will reduce risk for exposure and possible infection
    
more on raccoon latrine cleanup 
    
     
    
    
if you choose to clean the site yourself care should be taken to avoid contaminating hands and clothes
    
      wear disposable gloves to help prevent cross contamination
      wear a  respirator if working in a confined space to prevent accidental ingestion of eggs or other harmful materials
      avoid stirring up dust and debris you can lightly mist the latrine area with a little water from a spray bottle to reduce the amount of dust
      wear rubber boots that can be scrubbed or cover your shoes with disposable booties that can be thrown away so that you do not bring eggs into your household
      feces and material contaminated with raccoon feces should be removed and burned buried or sent to a landfill
      most chemicals do not kill roundworm eggs however heat kills the eggs instantly
      treat fecessoiled decks patios and other surfaces with boiling water or a propane torch please contact your local fire department for regulations and safety practices
    
    
to help further reduce the risk of possible infection wash your hands well with soap and warm running water cleanlaunder your clothes thoroughly with hot water and detergent
    
more on handwashing
    
if you are cleaning an indoor raccoon latrine and are not able to use a propane torch use a damp but not wet sponge to wipe the area with hot soapy water rinse your sponge frequently after you are finished flush dirty water down the toilet place the sponge in a plastic bag and put the plastic bag in the garbage
    
contact your local animal control office for additional assistance
    dogs
    
dogs may be infected with adult b procyonis roundworms but may not show symptoms have all pets dewormed under a veterinarians supervision and take precautions to avoid contact with their feces
    exotic pets
    
raccoons and dogs are not the only hosts of baylisascaris b procyonis infection has also been documented in kinkajous other animals such as coatis may be susceptible when wild animals are kept as pets there can be a risk of disease transmission to humans"

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to aspartylglucosaminuria ,mutations in the aga gene cause aspartylglucosaminuria the aga gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called aspartylglucosaminidase this enzyme is active in lysosomes which are structures inside cells that act as recycling centers within lysosomes the enzyme helps break down complexes of sugar molecules oligosaccharides attached to certain proteins glycoproteins  aga gene mutations result in the absence or shortage of the aspartylglucosaminidase enzyme in lysosomes preventing the normal breakdown of glycoproteins as a result glycoproteins can build up within the lysosomes excess glycoproteins disrupt the normal functions of the cell and can result in destruction of the cell a buildup of glycoproteins seems to particularly affect nerve cells in the brain loss of these cells causes many of the signs and symptoms of aspartylglucosaminuria
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to koolende vries syndrome ,koolende vries syndrome is caused by genetic changes that eliminate the function of one copy of the  gene in each cell most affected individuals are missing a small amount of genetic material including the  gene from one copy of chromosome  this type of genetic abnormality is called a microdeletion a small number of individuals with koolende vries syndrome do not have a chromosome  microdeletion but instead have a mutation within the  gene that causes one copy of the gene to be nonfunctional  the microdeletion that causes koolende vries syndrome occurs on the long q arm of chromosome  at a location designated  while the exact size of the deletion varies among affected individuals most are missing a sequence of about  dna building blocks base pairs containing several genes however because individuals with  gene mutations have the same signs and symptoms as those with the microdeletion researchers have concluded that the loss of this gene accounts for the features of this disorder  the  gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate gene activity expression by modifying chromatin chromatin is the complex of dna and protein that packages dna into chromosomes the protein produced from the  gene is found in most organs and tissues of the body before birth and throughout life by its involvement in controlling the activity of other genes this protein plays an important role in the development and function of many parts of the body loss of one copy of this gene impairs normal development and function but the relationship of  gene loss to the specific signs and symptoms of koolende vries syndrome is unclear
information,what is are glycogen storage disease type ix ,glycogen storage disease type ix also known as gsd ix is a condition caused by the inability to break down a complex sugar called glycogen the different forms of the condition can affect glycogen breakdown in liver cells or muscle cells or sometimes both a lack of glycogen breakdown interferes with the normal function of the affected tissue  when gsd ix affects the liver the signs and symptoms typically begin in early childhood the initial features are usually an enlarged liver hepatomegaly and slow growth affected children are often shorter than normal during prolonged periods without food fasting affected individuals may have low blood sugar hypoglycemia or elevated levels of ketones in the blood ketosis ketones are molecules produced during the breakdown of fats which occurs when stored sugars are unavailable affected children may have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting standing or walking and some have mild muscle weakness puberty is delayed in some adolescents with gsd ix in the form of the condition that affects the liver the signs and symptoms usually improve with age typically individuals catch up developmentally and adults reach normal height however some affected individuals have a buildup of scar tissue fibrosis in the liver which can rarely progress to irreversible liver disease cirrhosis  gsd ix can affect muscle tissue although this form of the condition is very rare and not well understood the features of this form of the condition can appear anytime from childhood to adulthood affected individuals may experience fatigue muscle pain and cramps especially during exercise exercise intolerance most affected individuals have muscle weakness that worsens over time gsd ix can cause myoglobinuria which occurs when muscle tissue breaks down abnormally and releases a protein called myoglobin that is excreted in the urine myoglobinuria can cause the urine to be red or brown  in a small number of people with gsd ix the liver and muscles are both affected these individuals develop a combination of the features described above although the muscle problems are usually mild
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to vitelliform macular dystrophy ,mutations in the  and  genes cause vitelliform macular dystrophy  mutations are responsible for best disease and for some cases of the adultonset form of vitelliform macular dystrophy changes in the  gene can also cause the adultonset form of vitelliform macular dystrophy however less than a quarter of all people with this form of the condition have mutations in the  or  gene in most cases the cause of the adultonset form is unknown  the  gene provides instructions for making a protein called bestrophin this protein acts as a channel that controls the movement of charged chlorine atoms chloride ions into or out of cells in the retina mutations in the  gene probably lead to the production of an abnormally shaped channel that cannot properly regulate the flow of chloride researchers have not determined how these malfunctioning channels are related to the buildup of lipofuscin in the macula and progressive vision loss  the  gene provides instructions for making a protein called peripherin  this protein is essential for the normal function of lightsensing photoreceptor cells in the retina mutations in the  gene cause vision loss by disrupting structures in these cells that contain lightsensing pigments it is unclear why  mutations affect only central vision in people with adultonset vitelliform macular dystrophy
treatment,what are the treatments for moyamoya disease ,there are several types of surgery that can restore blood flow revascularization to the brain by opening narrowed blood vessels or by bypassing blocked arteries children usually respond better to revascularization surgery than adults but the majority of individuals have no further strokes or related problems after surgery
inheritance,is osteopetrosis inherited ,osteopetrosis can have several different patterns of inheritance most commonly the disorder has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder most people with autosomal dominant osteopetrosis inherit the condition from an affected parent  osteopetrosis can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition  oledaid is inherited in an xlinked recessive pattern the ikbkg gene is located on the x chromosome which is one of the two sex chromosomes in males who have only one x chromosome one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition in females who have two x chromosomes a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene males are affected by xlinked recessive disorders much more frequently than females a characteristic of xlinked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass xlinked traits to their sons

exams and tests,how to diagnose hemochromatosis ,"health care providers use medical and family history a physical exam and routine blood tests to diagnose hemochromatosis or other conditions that could cause the same symptoms or complications
                
 medical and family history taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose hemochromatosis the health care provider will look for clues that may indicate hemochromatosis such as a family history of arthritis or unexplained liver disease     physical exam after taking a medical history a health care provider will perform a physical exam which may help diagnose hemochromatosis during a physical exam a health care provider usually       examines a patients body     uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds     taps on specific areas of the patients body       blood tests a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis blood tests can determine whether the amount of iron stored in the body is higher than        the transferrin saturation test shows how much iron is bound to the protein that carries iron in the blood transferrin saturation values above or equal to  percent are considered abnormal     the serum ferritin test detects the amount of ferritina protein that stores ironin the blood levels above  gl in men and  gl in women are considered abnormal levels above  gl in men or women indicate a high chance of iron overload and organ damage    if either test shows higherthanaverage levels of iron in the body health care providers can order a special blood test that can detect two copies of the  mutation to confirm the diagnosis if the mutation is not present health care providers will look for other causes     liver biopsy health care providers may perform a liver biopsy a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease the health care provider may ask the patient to temporarily stop taking certain medications before the liver biopsy the health care provider may ask the patient to fast for  hours before the procedure  during the procedure the patient lies on a table right hand resting above the head the health care provider applies a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle if needed a health care provider will also give sedatives and pain medication the health care provider uses a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue he or she may use ultrasound computerized tomography scans or other imaging techniques to guide the needle after the biopsy the patient must lie on the right side for up to  hours and is monitored an additional  to  hours before being sent home  a health care provider performs a liver biopsy at a hospital or an outpatient center the health care provider sends the liver sample to a pathology lab where the pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseaselooks at the tissue with a microscope and sends a report to the patients health care provider the biopsy shows how much iron has accumulated in the liver and whether the patient has liver damage
                
hemochromatosis is rare and health care providers may not think to test for this disease thus the disease is often not diagnosed or treated the initial symptoms can be diverse vague and similar to the symptoms of many other diseases health care providers may focus on the symptoms and complications caused by hemochromatosis rather than on the underlying iron overload however if a health care provider diagnoses and treats the iron overload caused by hemochromatosis before organ damage has occurred a person can live a normal healthy life
                

                
who should be tested for hemochromatosis   experts recommend testing for hemochromatosis in people who have symptoms complications or a family history of the disease   some researchers have suggested widespread screening for the  mutation in the general population however screening is not costeffective although the  mutation occurs quite frequently the disease caused by the mutation is rare and many people with two copies of the mutation never develop iron overload or organ damage   researchers and public health officials suggest the following    siblings of people who have hemochromatosis should have their blood tested to see if they have the  mutation    parents children and other close relatives of people who have hemochromatosis should consider being tested    health care providers should consider testing people who have severe and continuing fatigue unexplained cirrhosis joint pain or arthritis heart problems erectile dysfunction or diabetes because these health issues may result from hemochromatosis"

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to earlyonset glaucoma ,approximately  percent to  percent of people with juvenile openangle glaucoma have mutations in the myoc gene myoc gene mutations have also been detected in some people with primary congenital glaucoma the myoc gene provides instructions for producing a protein called myocilin myocilin is found in certain structures of the eye called the trabecular meshwork and the ciliary body that regulate the intraocular pressure  researchers believe that myocilin functions together with other proteins as part of a protein complex mutations may alter the protein in such a way that the complex cannot be formed defective myocilin that is not incorporated into functional complexes may accumulate in the trabecular meshwork and ciliary body the excess protein may prevent sufficient flow of fluid from the eye resulting in increased intraocular pressure and causing the signs and symptoms of earlyonset glaucoma  between  percent and  percent of people with primary congenital glaucoma have mutations in the  gene  gene mutations have also been detected in some people with juvenile openangle glaucoma the  gene provides instructions for producing a form of the cytochrome  protein like myocilin this protein is found in the trabecular meshwork ciliary body and other structures of the eye  it is not well understood how defects in the  protein cause signs and symptoms of glaucoma recent studies suggest that the defects may interfere with the early development of the trabecular meshwork in the clear covering of the eye the cornea the  protein may also be involved in a process that regulates the secretion of fluid inside the eye if this fluid is produced in excess the high intraocular pressure characteristic of glaucoma may develop  the  protein may interact with myocilin individuals with mutations in both the myoc and  genes may develop glaucoma at an earlier age and have more severe symptoms than do those with mutations in only one of the genes mutations in other genes may also be involved in earlyonset glaucoma
inheritance,is situs inversus inherited ,is situs inversus inherited the genetics of situs inversus is complex several familial cases have been reported in which the inheritance has been described as either autosomal recessive most commonly autosomal dominant or xlinked the condition appears to be genetically heterogeneous meaning that different genetic factors or genes may cause the condition among different people or families if situs inversus is associated with another underlying syndrome or condition the inheritance pattern may be the same as that of the underlying condition people with questions about genetic risks to themselves or family members are encouraged to speak with a genetics professional
susceptibility,who is at risk for renal artery stenosis ,"people at risk for artherosclerosis are also at risk for ras risk factors for ras caused by artherosclerosis include
                
 high blood cholesterol levels   high blood pressure   smoking   insulin resistance   diabetes   being overweight or obese   lack of physical activity   a diet high in fat cholesterol sodium and sugar   being a man older than  or a woman older than    a family history of early heart disease
                
the risk factors for ras caused by fmd are unknown but fmd is most common in women and people  to  years of  fmd can affect more than one person in a family indicating that it may be caused by an inherited gene"
causes,what causes heart block ,"heart block has many causes some people are born with the disorder congenital while others develop it during their lifetimes acquired
                
congenital heart block
                
one form of congenital heart block occurs in babies whose mothers have autoimmune diseases such as lupus people who have these diseases make proteins called antibodies that attack and damage the bodys tissues or cells
                
in pregnant women antibodies can cross the placenta the placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mothers womb these proteins can damage the babys heart and lead to congenital heart block
                
congenital heart defects also may cause congenital heart block these defects are problems with the hearts structure that are present at birth often doctors dont know what causes these defects
                
acquired heart block
                
many factors can cause acquired heart block examples include
                
damage to the heart from a heart attack this is the most common cause of acquired heart block
                
coronary heart disease also called coronary artery disease
                
myocarditis miokarditis or inflammation of the heart muscle
                
heart failure
                
rheumatic roomatik fever
                
cardiomyopathy kardeomiopathe or heart muscle diseases
                
other diseases may increase the risk of heart block examples include sarcoidosis sarkoydoesis and the degenerative muscle disorders levs disease and lenegres disease
                
certain types of surgery also may damage the hearts electrical system and lead to heart block
                
exposure to toxic substances and taking certain medicinesincluding digitalis beta blockers and calcium channel blockersalso may cause heart block doctors closely watch people who are taking these medicines for signs of problems
                
some types of heart block have been linked to genetic mutations changes in the genes
                
an overly active vagus nerve also can cause heart block you have one vagus nerve on each side of your body these nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate
                
in some cases acquired heart block may go away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved for example heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery
                
also if a medicine is causing heart block the disorder may go away if the medicine is stopped or the dosage is lowered always talk with your doctor before you change the way you take your medicines"
inheritance,is krabbe disease inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition
susceptibility,who is at risk for obesity hypoventilation syndrome ,"people who are obese are at risk for obesity hypoventilation syndrome ohs obesity refers to having too much body fat people who are obese have body weight thats greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height
                
the most useful measure of obesity is body mass index bmi bmi is calculated from your height and weight in adults a bmi of  or more is considered obese
                
you can use the national heart lung and blood institutes nhlbis online bmi calculator to figure out your bmi or your doctor can help you
                
if you are obese youre at greater risk for ohs if your bmi is  or higher youre also at greater risk if most of your excess weight is around your waist rather than at your hips this is referred to as abdominal obesity
                
ohs tends to occur more often in men than women at the time of diagnosis most people are  to  years old"
information,what is are mastocytic enterocolitis ,mastocytic enterocolitis is a term describing the condition of chronic intractable diarrhea in people with normal colon or duodenum biopsy results but with an increased number of mast cells in the colonic mucosa the innermost layer of the colon the increase in mast cells is not associated with systemic or cutaneous mastocytosis it is unclear whether the accumulation of mast cells is a response to or cause of the mucosal inflammation that causes the symptoms of the condition most individuals with this condition respond well to drugs affecting mast cell function
treatment,what are the treatments for adiposis dolorosa ,these resources address the diagnosis or management of adiposis dolorosa   genetic testing registry lipomatosis dolorosa   merck manual consumer version lipomas   these resources from medlineplus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions   diagnostic tests   drug therapy   surgery and rehabilitation   genetic counseling    palliative care
treatment,what are the treatments for what i need to know about hirschsprung disease ,"pullthrough procedure
                
hd is treated with surgery called a pullthrough procedure a surgeon removes the segment of the large intestine lacking nerve cells and connects the healthy segment to the anus the pullthrough procedure is usually done soon after diagnosis
                
ostomy surgery
                
an ostomy allows stool to leave the body through an opening in the abdomen although most children with hd do not need an ostomy a child who has been very sick from hd may need an ostomy to get better before the pullthrough procedure
                
for ostomy surgery the surgeon first takes out the diseased segment of the large intestine the end of the healthy intestine is moved to an opening in the abdomen where a stoma is created a stoma is created by rolling the intestines end back on itself like a shirt cuff and stitching it to the abdominal wall an ostomy pouch is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect stool the pouch will need to be emptied several times each day
                

                
if the surgeon removes the entire large intestine and connects the small intestine to the stoma the surgery is called an ileostomy if the surgeon leaves part of the large intestine and connects it to the stoma the surgery is called a colostomy
                
later during the pullthrough procedure the surgeon removes the stoma and closes the abdomen with stitches"

information,what is are bird flu ,birds just like people get the flu bird flu viruses infect birds including chickens other poultry and wild birds such as ducks most bird flu viruses can only infect other birds however bird flu can pose health risks to people the first case of a bird flu virus infecting a person directly  was in hong kong in  since then the bird flu virus has spread to birds in countries in asia africa the middle east and europe    human infection is still very rare but the virus that causes the infection in birds might change or mutate to more easily infect humans this could lead to a pandemic a worldwide outbreak of the illness     during an outbreak of bird flu people who have contact with infected birds can become sick it may also be possible to catch bird flu by eating poultry or eggs that are not well cooked or through contact with a person who has it bird flu can make people very sick or even cause death antiviral medicines may make the illness less severe and may help prevent the flu in people who were exposed to it there is currently no vaccine
exams and tests,how to diagnose arrhythmia ,"arrhythmias can be hard to diagnose especially the types that only cause symptoms every once in a while doctors diagnose arrhythmias based on medical and family histories a physical exam and the results from tests and procedures
                
specialists involved
                
doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases include
                
cardiologists these doctors diagnose and treat adults who have heart problems
                
pediatric cardiologists these doctors diagnose and treat babies children and youth who have heart problems
                
electrophysiologists these doctors are cardiologists or pediatric cardiologists who specialize in arrhythmias
                
medical and family histories
                
to diagnose an arrhythmia your doctor may ask you to describe your symptoms he or she may ask whether you feel fluttering in your chest and whether you feel dizzy or lightheaded
                
your doctor also may ask whether you have other health problems such as a history of heart disease high blood pressure diabetes or thyroid problems he or she may ask about your familys medical history including whether anyone in your family
                
has a history of arrhythmias
                
has ever had heart disease or high blood pressure
                
has died suddenly
                
has other illnesses or health problems
                
your doctor will likely want to know what medicines youre taking including overthecounter medicines and supplements
                
your doctor may ask about your health habits such as physical activity smoking or using alcohol or drugs for example cocaine he or she also may want to know whether youve had emotional stress or anger
                
physical exam
                
during a physical exam your doctor may
                
listen to the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat
                
listen to your heart for a heart murmur an extra or unusual sound heard during your heartbeat
                
check your pulse to find out how fast your heart is beating
                
check for swelling in your legs or feet which could be a sign of an enlarged heart or heart failure
                
look for signs of other diseases such as thyroid disease that could be causing the problem
                
diagnostic tests and procedures
                
ekg electrocardiogram
                
an ekg is a simple painless test that detects and records the hearts electrical activity its the most common test used to diagnose arrhythmias
                
an ekg shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm steady or irregular it also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart
                
a standard ekg only records the heartbeat for a few seconds it wont detect arrhythmias that dont happen during the test
                
to diagnose arrhythmias that come and go your doctor may have you wear a portable ekg monitor the two most common types of portable ekgs are holter and event monitors
                
holter and event monitors
                
a holter monitor records the hearts electrical signals for a full  or  period you wear one while you do your normal daily activities this allows the monitor to record your heart for a longer time than a standard ekg
                
an event monitor is similar to a holter monitor you wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities however an event monitor only records your hearts electrical activity at certain times while youre wearing it
                
for many event monitors you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms
                
some event monitors are able to send data about your hearts electrical activity to a central monitoring station technicians at the station review the information and send it to your doctor you also can use the device to report any symptoms youre having
                
you can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur
                
other tests
                
other tests also are used to help diagnose arrhythmias
                
blood tests blood tests check the level of substances in the blood such as potassium and thyroid hormone abnormal levels of these substances can increase your chances of having an arrhythmia
                
chest x ray a chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in your chest such as your heart and lungs this test can show whether your heart is enlarged
                
echocardiography this test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart echocardiography echo provides information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working
                
the test also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart areas of heart muscle that arent contracting normally and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow
                
there are several types of echo including stress echo this test is done both before and after a stress test see below a stress echo usually is done to find out whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart a sign of coronary heart disease chd
                
a transesophageal tranzihsofuhjeeul echo or tee is a special type of echo that takes pictures of the heart through the esophagus the esophagus is the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach
                
stress test some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast during stress testing you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done if you cant exercise you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast
                
the heart tests done during stress testing may include nuclear heart scanning echo and positron emission tomography pet scanning of the heart
                
electrophysiology study eps this test is used to assess serious arrhythmias during an eps a thin flexible wire is passed through a vein in your groin upper thigh or arm to your heart the wire records your hearts electrical signals
                
your doctor can use the wire to electrically stimulate your heart and trigger an arrhythmia this allows your doctor to see whether an antiarrhythmia medicine can stop the problem
                
catheter ablation a procedure used to treat some arrhythmias may be done during an eps
                
tilt table testing this test sometimes is used to help find the cause of fainting spells you lie on a table that moves from a lying down to an upright position the change in position may cause you to faint
                
your doctor watches your symptoms heart rate ekg reading and blood pressure throughout the test he or she may give you medicine and then check your response to the medicine
                
coronary angiography coronary angiography uses dye and special x rays to show the inside of your coronary arteries to get the dye into your coronary arteries your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization katheterihzashun
                
a thin flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm groin upper thigh or neck the tube is threaded into your coronary arteries and the dye is released into your bloodstream
                
special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries the dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels this helps your doctor find blockages that can cause a heart attack
                
implantable loop recorder this device detects abnormal heart rhythms minor surgery is used to place this device under the skin in the chest area
                
an implantable loop recorder helps doctors figure out why a person may be having palpitations or fainting spells especially if these symptoms dont happen very often the device can be used for as long as  to  months"

treatment,what are the treatments for neurological complications of aids ,"no single treatment can cure the neurological complications of aids some disorders require aggressive therapy while others are treated symptomatically
                
medicines range from analgesics sold over the counter to antiepileptic drugs opiates corticosteroids and some classes of antidepressants other treatments include radiation therapy or chemotherapy to kill or shrink cancerous brain tumors that may be caused by hiv antifungal or antimalarial drugs to combat certain bacterial infections and penicillin to treat neurosyphilis aggressive antiretroviral therapy is used to treat aids dementia complex pml and cytomegalovirus encephalitis haart or highly active antiretroviral therapy combines at least three drugs to reduce the amount of virus circulating in the blood and may also delay the start of some infections"
inheritance,is pulmonary arterial hypertension inherited ,pulmonary arterial hypertension is usually sporadic which means it occurs in individuals with no known family history of the disorder these nonfamilial cases are described as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension about  percent of these cases are caused by mutations in one of the genes known to be associated with the disease but most of the time a causative gene mutation has not been identified  inherited cases of this disorder are known as familial pulmonary arterial hypertension when the condition is inherited it most often has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder however many people with an altered gene never develop pulmonary arterial hypertension this phenomenon is called reduced penetrance

susceptibility,who is at risk for parasites  african trypanosomiasis also known as sleeping sickness ,"there are two subspecies of the parasite trypanosoma brucei that cause disease in humans the clinical features of the infection depend on the subspecies involved the two subspecies are found in different regions of africa at present there is no overlap in their geographic distribution
    
t b rhodesiense east african sleeping sickness is found in focal areas of eastern and southeastern africa each year a few hundred cases are reported to the world health organization over  of the cases of human infection occur in tanzania uganda malawi and zambia animals are the primary reservoir of infection cattle have been implicated in the spread of the disease to new areas and in local outbreaks a wild animal reservoir is thought to be responsible for sporadic transmission to hunters and visitors to game parks infection of international travelers is rare but it occasionally occurs in the us one case per year on average is diagnosed most cases of sleeping sickness imported into the us have been in travelers who were on safari in east africa
    
t b gambiense west african sleeping sickness is found predominantly in central africa and in limited areas of west africa most of the sleeping sickness in africa is caused by this form of the parasite epidemics of sleeping sickness have been a significant public health problem in the past but the disease is reasonably wellcontrolled at present with  cases reported annually in recent years over  of the cases of human infection are found in democratic republic of congo angola sudan central african republic chad and northern uganda humans are the important reservoir of infection although the parasite can sometimes be found in domestic animals eg pigs dogs goats imported infection in the us is extremely rare and most cases have occurred in african nationals who have immigrated rather than in returning us travelers
    
     
    
    
both forms of sleeping sickness are transmitted by the bite of the tsetse fly glossina species tsetse flies inhabit rural areas living in the woodlands and thickets that dot the east african savannah in central and west africa they live in the forests and vegetation along streams tsetse flies bite during daylight hours both male and female flies can transmit the infection but even in areas where the disease is endemic only a very small percentage of flies are infected although the vast majority of infections are transmitted by the tsetse fly other modes of transmission are possible occasionally a pregnant woman can pass the infection to her unborn baby in theory the infection can also be transmitted by blood transfusion or sexual contact but such cases have rarely been documented

treatment for hemolytic uremic syndrome includes maintaining normal salt and fluid levels in the body to ease symptoms and prevent further problems a child may need a transfusion of red blood cells delivered through an intravenous iv tube some children may need dialysis for a short time to take over the work the kidneys usually do most children recover completely with no longterm consequences more information is provided in the niddk health topic hemolytic uremic syndrome in children
                
children with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis may be treated with antibiotics to destroy any bacteria that remain in the body and with medications to control swelling and high blood pressure they may also need dialysis for a short period of time more information about poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is provided in the niddk health topic glomerular diseases
                
nephrotic syndrome
                
nephrotic syndrome due to minimal change disease can often be successfully treated with corticosteroids corticosteroids decrease swelling and reduce the activity of the immune system the dosage of the medication is decreased over time relapses are common however they usually respond to treatment corticosteroids are less effective in treating nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis children with these conditions may be given other immunosuppressive medications in addition to corticosteroids immunosuppressive medications prevent the body from making antibodies more information is provided in the niddk health topic childhood nephrotic syndrome
                
systemic diseases

urine blockage and reflux
                
treatment for urine blockage depends on the cause and severity of the blockage in some cases the blockage goes away without treatment for children who continue to have urine blockage surgery may be needed to remove the obstruction and restore urine flow after surgery a small tube called a stent may be placed in the ureter or urethra to keep it open temporarily while healing occurs more information is provided in the niddk health topic urine blockage in newborns
                
treatment for reflux may include prompt treatment of urinary tract infections and longterm use of antibiotics to prevent infections until reflux goes away on its own surgery has also been used in certain cases more information is provided in the niddk health topic vesicoureteral reflux"

considerations,what to do for crohns disease ,"researchers have not found that eating diet and nutrition cause crohns disease symptoms good nutrition is important in the management of crohns disease however dietary changes can help reduce symptoms a health care provider may recommend that a person make dietary changes such as
                
 avoiding carbonated drinks   avoiding popcorn vegetable skins nuts and other highfiber foods   drinking more liquids   eating smaller meals more often   keeping a food diary to help identify troublesome foods
                
health care providers may recommend nutritional supplements and vitamins for people who do not absorb enough nutrients
                
to help ensure coordinated and safe care people should discuss their use of complementary and alternative medical practices including their use of dietary supplements and probiotics with their health care provider read more at wwwnccamnihgovhealthprobiotics

causes,what causes subacute cerebellar degeneration ,what causes subacute cerebellar degeneration subacute cerebellar degeneration may occur when the bodys immune system attacks healthy tissue either for unknown reasons or as an abnormal reaction to an underlying cancer these cases are referred to as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration subacute cerebellar degeneration may also occur due to thiamine deficiency causes of thiamin deficiency include alcoholism recurrent vomiting gastric surgery and diets poor in this b vitamin these cases are referred to as alcoholicnutritional cerebellar degeneration for further information pertaining to the neurological effects of severe thiamine deficiency see the following link to the wernickekorsakoff syndrome resource page 
symptoms,what are the symptoms of cystic fibrosis ,"the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis cf vary from person to person and over time sometimes youll have few symptoms other times your symptoms may become more severe
                
one of the first signs of cf that parents may notice is that their babys skin tastes salty when kissed or the baby doesnt pass stool when first born
                
most of the other signs and symptoms of cf happen later theyre related to how cf affects the respiratory digestive or reproductive systems of the body
                
cystic fibrosis
                

                
respiratory system signs and symptoms
                
people who have cf have thick sticky mucus that builds up in their airways this buildup of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum spit or mucus thats sometimes bloody
                
people who have cf tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that dont respond to standard antibiotics for example lung infections caused by bacteria called mucoid pseudomonas are much more common in people who have cf than in those who dont an infection caused by these bacteria may be a sign of cf
                
people who have cf have frequent bouts of sinusitis sinusitis an infection of the sinuses the sinuses are hollow air spaces around the eyes nose and forehead frequent bouts of bronchitis bronkitis and pneumonia numoneah also can occur these infections can cause longterm lung damage
                
as cf gets worse you may have more serious problems such as pneumothorax noomothoraks or bronchiectasis brongkeektasis
                
some people who have cf also develop nasal polyps growths in the nose that may require surgery
                
digestive system signs and symptoms
                
in cf mucus can block tubes or ducts in your pancreas an organ in your abdomen these blockages prevent enzymes from reaching your intestines
                
as a result your intestines cant fully absorb fats and proteins this can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky foulsmelling greasy stools intestinal blockages also may occur especially in newborns too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort
                
a hallmark of cf in children is poor weight gain and growth these children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins
                
as cf gets worse other problems may occur such as
                
pancreatitis pankreahtitis this is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed which causes pain
                
rectal prolapse frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum
                
liver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts
                
diabetes
                
gallstones
                
reproductive system signs and symptoms
                
men who have cf are infertile because theyre born without a vas deferens the vas deferens is a tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis
                
women who have cf may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking the cervix or other cf complications
                
other signs symptoms and complications
                
other signs and symptoms of cf are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood
                
cf causes your sweat to become very salty as a result your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat this can cause dehydration a lack of fluid in your body increased heart rate fatigue tiredness weakness decreased blood pressure heat stroke and rarely death
                
cf also can cause clubbing and low bone density clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes this sign develops late in cf because your lungs arent moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream
                
low bone density also tends to occur late in cf it can lead to bonethinning disorders called osteoporosis and osteopenia"
frequency,how many people are affected by hereditary pancreatitis ,hereditary pancreatitis is thought to be a rare condition in europe its prevalence is estimated to be  to  per million individuals
information,what is are methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria type cblc ,methylmalonic academia with homocystinuria mmahcu cblc is a genetic disorder that prevents the body from breaking down certain amino acids found in protein ie isoleucine valine methionine and threonine as a result homocystine methylmalonic acid and other harmful substances buildup in the body treatment should begin as soon as possible in general treatment may involve a lowprotein diet medical formuladrink regular meals careful monitoring and vitamin  shots most us states now offer newborn screening for mmahcu allowing for early detection and treatment however even with early treatment most children with mmahcu experience some symptoms affecting vision growth and learning mmahcu cblc type is caused by changes in the mmachc gene it is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion

treatment,what are the treatments for multiple sclerosis ,"there is as yet no cure for ms many patients do well with no therapy at all especially since many medications have serious side effects and some carry significant risks however three forms of beta interferon avonex betaseron and rebif have now been approved by the food and drug administration for treatment of relapsingremitting ms beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability when attacks do occur they tend to be shorter and less severe the fda also has approved a synthetic form of myelin basic protein called copolymer i copaxone for the treatment of relapsingremitting ms copolymer i has few side effects and studies indicate that the agent can reduce the relapse rate by almost one third other fda approved drugs to treat relapsing forms of ms in adults include teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate an immunosuppressant treatment novantrone mitoxantrone isapproved by the fda for the treatment of advanced or chronic ms the fda has also approved dalfampridine ampyra to improve walking in individuals with ms
                
one monoclonal antibody natalizumab tysabri was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce the frequency of attacks in people with relapsing forms of ms and was approved for marketing by the us food and drug administration fda in  however in  the drugs manufacturer voluntarily suspended marketing of the drug after several reports of significant adverse events in  the fda again approved sale of the drug for ms but under strict treatment guidelines involving infusion centers where patients can be monitored by specially trained physicians
                
while steroids do not affect the course of ms over time they can reduce the duration and severity of attacks in some patients spasticity which can occur either as a sustained stiffness caused by increased muscle tone or as spasms that come and go is usually treated with muscle relaxants and tranquilizers such as baclofen tizanidine diazepam clonazepam and dantrolene physical therapy and exercise can help preserve remaining function and patients may find that various aids  such as foot braces canes and walkers  can help them remain independent and mobile avoiding excessive activity and avoiding heat are probably the most important measures patients can take to counter physiological fatigue if psychological symptoms of fatigue such as depression or apathy are evident antidepressant medications may help other drugs that may reduce fatigue in some but not all patients include amantadine symmetrel pemoline cylert and the stillexperimental drug aminopyridine although improvement of optic symptoms usually occurs even without treatment a short course of treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone solumedrol followed by treatment with oral steroids is sometimes used"
symptoms,what are the symptoms of tremors nystagmus and duodenal ulcers ,what are the signs and symptoms of tremors nystagmus and duodenal ulcers the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for tremors nystagmus and duodenal ulcers if the information is available the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms signs and symptoms approximate number of patients when available abnormality of the gastric mucosa  nystagmus  incoordination  abnormality of the cerebellum  autosomal dominant inheritance  duodenal ulcer  tremor  the human phenotype ontology hpo has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition much of this information comes from orphanet a european rare disease database the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature the frequency may also be listed as a fraction the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study for example a frequency of  means that in a study of  people all patients were found to have that symptom because these frequencies are based on a specific study the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined sometimes no information on frequency is available in these cases the sign or symptom may be rare or common
treatment,what are the treatments for diabetic retinopathy ,preventing disease progression during the first three stages of diabetic retinopathy no treatment is needed unless you have macular edema to prevent progression of diabetic retinopathy people with diabetes should control their levels of blood sugar blood pressure and blood cholesterol treatment for macular edema research found that that prompt treatment of macular edema with antivegf drugs with or without laser treatment resulted in better vision than laser treatment alone or steroid injections when injected into the eye these drugs reduce fluid leakage and interfere with the growth of new blood vessels in the retina in some cases focal laser treatment is used along with the eye injections your doctor places up to several hundred small laser burns in the areas of the retina around the macula that are leaking these burns slow the leakage of fluid and reduce the amount of fluid in the retina the surgery is usually completed in one session further treatment may be needed treatment for diabetic retinopathy proliferative retinopathy is treated with laser surgery this procedure is called scatter laser treatment scatter laser treatment helps to shrink the abnormal blood vessels your doctor places  to  laser burns in the areas of the retina away from the macula causing the abnormal blood vessels to shrink because a high number of laser burns are necessary two or more sessions usually are required to complete treatment although you may notice some loss of your side vision scatter laser treatment can save the rest of your sight scatter laser treatment may slightly reduce your color vision and night vision scatter laser treatment works better before the fragile new blood vessels have started to bleed that is why it is important to have regular comprehensive dilated eye exams even if bleeding has started scatter laser treatment may still be possible depending on the amount of bleeding  learn more about laser treatment  vitrectomy if the bleeding is severe you may need a surgical procedure called a vitrectomy during a vitrectomy blood is removed from the center of your eye scatter laser treatment and vitrectomy are effective in treating proliferative retinopathy and in reducing vision loss once you have proliferative retinopathy you always will be at risk for new bleeding you may need treatment more than once to protect your sight  learn more about a vitrectomy  have dilated eye exams the national eye institute nei urges everyone with diabetes to have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year if you have diabetic retinopathy you may need an exam more often people with proliferative retinopathy can reduce their risk of blindness by  percent with timely treatment and appropriate followup care  watch an animation to see what a comprehensive dilated eye exam includes  research the national eye institute or nei is conducting and supporting research that seeks better ways to detect treat and prevent vision loss in people with diabetes this research is conducted through studies in the laboratory and with patients for example researchers are studying drugs for the treatment of proliferative retinopathy that may reduce the need for laser surgery a major study has shown that better control of blood sugar levels slows the onset and progression of retinopathy the people with diabetes who kept their blood sugar levels as close to normal as possible also had much less kidney and nerve disease better control also reduces the need for sightsaving laser surgery
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated cebpa ,as its name suggests familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated cebpa is caused by mutations in the cebpa gene that are passed down within families these inherited mutations are present throughout a persons life in virtually every cell in the body  the cebpa gene provides instructions for making a protein called ccaatenhancerbinding protein alpha this protein is a transcription factor which means that it attaches binds to specific regions of dna and helps control the activity of certain genes it is believed to act as a tumor suppressor helping to prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way  cebpa gene mutations that cause familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated cebpa result in a shorter version of ccaatenhancerbinding protein alpha this shorter version is produced from one copy of the cebpa gene in each cell and it is believed to interfere with the tumor suppressor function of the normal protein produced from the second copy of the gene absence of the tumor suppressor function of ccaatenhancerbinding protein alpha is believed to disrupt the regulation of blood cell production in the bone marrow leading to the uncontrolled production of abnormal cells that occurs in acute myeloid leukemia  in addition to the inherited mutation in one copy of the cebpa gene in each cell most individuals with familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated cebpa also acquire a mutation in the second copy of the cebpa gene the additional mutation which is called a somatic mutation is found only in the leukemia cells and is not inherited the somatic cebpa gene mutations identified in leukemia cells generally decrease the dnabinding ability of ccaatenhancerbinding protein alpha the effect of this second mutation on the development of acute myeloid leukemia is unclear
treatment,what are the treatments for patent ductus arteriosus ,"patent ductus arteriosus pda is treated with medicines catheterbased procedures and surgery the goal of treatment is to close the pda closure will help prevent complications and reverse the effects of increased blood volume
                
small pdas often close without treatment for fullterm infants treatment is needed if the pda is large or causing health problems for premature infants treatment is needed if the pda is causing breathing problems or heart problems
                
talk with your childs doctor about treatment options and how your family prefers to handle treatment decisions
                
medicines
                
your childs doctor may prescribe medicines to help close your childs pda
                
indomethacin indohmethahsin is a medicine that helps close pdas in premature infants this medicine triggers the pda to constrict or tighten which closes the opening indomethacin usually doesnt work in fullterm infants
                
ibuprofen also is used to close pdas in premature infants this medicine is similar to indomethacin
                
catheterbased procedures
                
catheters are thin flexible tubes that doctors use as part of a procedure called cardiac catheterization kathehterihzashun catheterbased procedures often are used to close pdas in infants or children who are large enough to have the procedure
                
your childs doctor may refer to the procedure as transcatheter device closure the procedure sometimes is used for small pdas to prevent the risk of infective endocarditis ie ie is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves
                
your child will be given medicine to help him or her relax or sleep during the procedure the doctor will insert a catheter in a large blood vessel in the groin upper thigh he or she will then guide the catheter to your childs heart
                
a small metal coil or other blocking device is passed through the catheter and placed in the pda this device blocks blood flow through the vessel
                
catheterbased procedures dont require the childs chest to be opened they also allow the child to recover quickly
                
these procedures often are done on an outpatient basis youll most likely be able to take your child home the same day the procedure is done
                
complications from catheterbased procedures are rare and short term they can include bleeding infection and movement of the blocking device from where it was placed
                
surgery
                
surgery to correct a pda may be done if
                
a premature or fullterm infant has health problems due to a pda and is too small to have a catheterbased procedure
                
a catheterbased procedure doesnt successfully close the pda
                
surgery is planned for treatment of related congenital heart defects
                
often surgery isnt done until after  months of age in infants who dont have health problems from their pdas doctors sometimes do surgery on small pdas to prevent the risk of ie
                
for the surgery your child will be given medicine so that he or she will sleep and not feel any pain the surgeon will make a small incision cut between your childs ribs to reach the pda he or she will close the pda using stitches or clips
                
complications from surgery are rare and usually short term they can include hoarseness a paralyzed diaphragm the muscle below the lungs infection bleeding or fluid buildup around the lungs
                
after surgery
                
after surgery your child will spend a few days in the hospital he or she will be given medicine to reduce pain and anxiety most children go home  days after surgery premature infants usually have to stay in the hospital longer because of their other health issues
                
the doctors and nurses at the hospital will teach you how to care for your child at home they will talk to you about
                
limits on activity for your child while he or she recovers
                
followup appointments with your childs doctors
                
how to give your child medicines at home if needed
                
when your child goes home after surgery you can expect that he or she will feel fairly comfortable however you child may have some shortterm pain
                
your child should begin to eat better and gain weight quickly within a few weeks he or she should fully recover and be able to take part in normal activities
                
longterm complications from surgery are rare however they can include narrowing of the aorta incomplete closure of the pda and reopening of the pda"

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to ellisvan creveld syndrome ,ellisvan creveld syndrome can be caused by mutations in the evc or  gene little is known about the function of these genes although they appear to play important roles in celltocell signaling during development in particular the proteins produced from the evc and  genes are thought to help regulate the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway this pathway plays roles in cell growth cell specialization and the normal shaping patterning of many parts of the body  the mutations that cause ellisvan creveld syndrome result in the production of an abnormally small nonfunctional version of the evc or  protein it is unclear how the defective proteins lead to the specific signs and symptoms of this condition studies suggest that they prevent normal sonic hedgehog signaling in the developing embryo disrupting the formation and growth of the bones teeth and other parts of the body  together mutations in the evc and  genes account for more than half of all cases of ellisvan creveld syndrome the cause of the remaining cases is unknown
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to betaketothiolase deficiency ,mutations in the  gene cause betaketothiolase deficiency this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in the energyproducing centers within cells mitochondria this enzyme plays an essential role in breaking down proteins and fats from the diet specifically the  enzyme helps process isoleucine which is a building block of many proteins and ketones which are produced during the breakdown of fats  mutations in the  gene reduce or eliminate the activity of the  enzyme a shortage of this enzyme prevents the body from processing proteins and fats properly as a result related compounds can build up to toxic levels in the blood these substances cause the blood to become too acidic ketoacidosis which can damage the bodys tissues and organs particularly in the nervous system
information,what is are caffey disease ,caffey disease also called infantile cortical hyperostosis is a bone disorder that most often occurs in babies excessive new bone formation hyperostosis is characteristic of caffey disease the bone abnormalities mainly affect the jawbone shoulder blades scapulae collarbones clavicles and the shafts diaphyses of long bones in the arms and legs affected bones may double or triple in width which can be seen by xray imaging in some cases two bones that are next to each other such as two ribs or the pairs of long bones in the forearms radius and ulna or lower legs tibia and fibula become fused together babies with caffey disease also have swelling of joints and of soft tissues such as muscles with pain and redness in the affected areas affected infants can also be feverish and irritable  the signs and symptoms of caffey disease are usually apparent by the time an infant is  months old in rare cases skeletal abnormalities can be detected by ultrasound imaging during the last few weeks of development before birth lethal prenatal cortical hyperostosis a more severe disorder that appears earlier in development and is often fatal before or shortly after birth is sometimes called lethal prenatal caffey disease however it is generally considered to be a separate disorder  for unknown reasons the swelling and pain associated with caffey disease typically go away within a few months through a normal process called bone remodeling which replaces old bone tissue with new bone the excess bone is usually reabsorbed by the body and undetectable on xray images by the age of  however if two adjacent bones have fused they may remain that way possibly resulting in complications for example fused rib bones can lead to curvature of the spine scoliosis or limit expansion of the chest resulting in breathing problems  most people with caffey disease have no further problems related to the disorder after early childhood occasionally another episode of hyperostosis occurs years later in addition some adults who had caffey disease in infancy have other abnormalities of the bones and connective tissues which provide strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body affected adults may have loose joints joint laxity stretchy hyperextensible skin or be prone to protrusion of organs through gaps in muscles hernias
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to von hippellindau syndrome ,mutations in the vhl gene cause von hippellindau syndrome the vhl gene is a tumor suppressor gene which means it keeps cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way mutations in this gene prevent production of the vhl protein or lead to the production of an abnormal version of the protein an altered or missing vhl protein cannot effectively regulate cell survival and division as a result cells grow and divide uncontrollably to form the tumors and cysts that are characteristic of von hippellindau syndrome
information,what is are cyclic neutropenia ,cyclic neutropenia is a disorder that causes frequent infections and other health problems in affected individuals people with this condition have recurrent episodes of neutropenia during which there is a shortage deficiency of neutrophils neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in inflammation and in fighting infection the episodes of neutropenia are apparent at birth or soon afterward for most affected individuals neutropenia recurs every  days and lasts about  to  days  neutropenia makes it more difficult for the body to fight off pathogens such as bacteria and viruses so people with cyclic neutropenia typically develop recurrent infections of the sinuses respiratory tract and skin additionally people with this condition often develop open sores ulcers in the mouth and colon inflammation of the throat pharyngitis and gums gingivitis recurrent fever or abdominal pain people with cyclic neutropenia have these health problems only during episodes of neutropenia at times when their neutrophil levels are normal they are not at an increased risk of infection and inflammation

frequency,how many people are affected by alagille syndrome ,"alagille syndrome occurs in about one of every  live  the disorder affects both sexes equally and shows no geographical racial or ethnic preferences
                
 and  gene mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant way which means a child can get alagille syndrome by inheriting either of the gene mutations from only one parent each child of a parent with an autosomal dominant mutation has a  percent chance of inheriting the mutated gene
                
the following chart shows the chance of inheriting an autosomal dominant gene mutation
                
the gene mutations that cause alagille syndrome may cause mild or subtle symptoms some people may not know they are affected while others with the gene mutation may develop more serious characteristics of alagille syndrome a person with a gene mutation whether showing serious symptoms or not has alagille syndrome and can pass the gene mutation to a child

treatment,what are the treatments for crohns disease ,"a health care provider treats crohns disease with
                
 medications   bowel rest   surgery
                
which treatment a person needs depends on the severity of the disease and symptoms each person experiences crohns disease differently so health care providers adjust treatments to improve the persons symptoms and induce or bring about remission
                
medications
                
while no medication cures crohns disease many can reduce symptoms the goals of medication therapy are
                
 inducing and maintaining remission   improving the persons quality of life
                
many people with crohns disease require medication therapy health care providers will prescribe medications depending on the persons symptoms
                
 aminosalicylates   corticosteroids   immunomodulators   biologic therapies   other medications
                
aminosalicylates are medications that contain  acid  which helps control inflammation health care providers use aminosalicylates to treat people newly diagnosed with crohns disease who have mild symptoms aminosalicylates include
                
 balsalazide   mesalamine   olsalazine   sulfasalazinea combination of sulfapyridine and 
                
some of the common side effects of aminosalicylates include
                
 abdominal pain   diarrhea   headaches   heartburn   nausea and vomiting
                
corticosteroids also known as steroids help reduce the activity of the immune system and decrease inflammation health care providers prescribe corticosteroids for people with moderate to severe symptoms corticosteroids include
                
 budesonide   hydrocortisone   methylprednisone   prednisone
                
side effects of corticosteroids include
                
 acne   a higher chance of developing infections   bone mass loss   high blood glucose   high blood pressure   mood swings   weight gain
                
in most cases health care providers do not prescribe corticosteroids for longterm use
                
immunomodulators reduce immune system activity resulting in less inflammation in the gi tract these medications can take several weeks to  months to start working immunomodulators include
                
  or    azathioprine   cyclosporine   methotrexate
                
health care providers prescribe these medications to help people with crohns disease go into remission or to help people who do not respond to other treatments people taking these medications may have the following side effects
                
 a low white blood cell count which can lead to a higher chance of infection   fatigue or feeling tired   nausea and vomiting   pancreatitis
                
health care providers most often prescribe cyclosporine only to people with severe crohns disease because of the medications serious side effects people should talk with their health care provider about the risks and benefits of cyclosporine
                
biologic therapies are medications that target a protein made by the immune system neutralizing this protein decreases inflammation in the intestine biologic therapies work quickly to bring on remission especially in people who do not respond to other medications biologic therapies include
                
 adalimumab   certolizumab   infliximab   natalizumab   vedolizumab
                
health care providers most often give patients infliximab every  to  weeks at a hospital or an outpatient center side effects may include a toxic reaction to the medication and a higher chance of developing infections particularly tuberculosis
                
other medications to treat symptoms or complications may include
                
 acetaminophen for mild pain people with crohns disease should avoid using ibuprofen naproxen and aspirin since these medications can make symptoms worse   antibiotics to prevent or treat infections and fistulas   loperamide to help slow or stop severe diarrhea in most cases people only take this medication for short periods of time since it can increase the chance of developing megacolon
                
bowel rest
                
sometimes crohns disease symptoms are severe and a person may need to rest his or her bowel for a few days to several weeks bowel rest involves drinking only clear liquids or having no oral intake to provide the patient with nutrition a health care provider will deliver iv nutrition through a special catheter or tube inserted into a vein in the patients arm some patients stay in the hospital while other patients are able to receive the treatment at home in most cases the intestines are able to heal during bowel rest
                
surgery
                
even with medication treatments up to  percent of people will need surgery to treat their crohns  although surgery will not cure crohns disease it can treat complications and improve symptoms health care providers most often recommend surgery to treat
                
 fistulas   bleeding that is life threatening   bowel obstructions   side effects from medications when they threaten a persons health   symptoms when medications do not improve a persons condition
                
a surgeon can perform different types of operations to treat crohns disease
                
 small bowel resection   subtotal colectomy   proctocolectomy and ileostomy
                
patients will receive general anesthesia most patients will stay in the hospital for  to  days after the surgery full recovery may take  to  weeks
                
small bowel resection small bowel resection is surgery to remove part of a patients small intestine when a patient with crohns disease has a blockage or severe disease in the small intestine a surgeon may need to remove that section of intestine the two types of small bowel resection are
                
 laparoscopicwhen a surgeon makes several small halfinch incisions in the patients abdomen the surgeon inserts a laparoscopea thin tube with a tiny light and video camera on the endthrough the small incisions the camera sends a magnified image from inside the body to a video monitor giving the surgeon a closeup view of the small intestine while watching the monitor the surgeon inserts tools through the small incisions and removes the diseased or blocked section of small intestine the surgeon will reconnect the ends of the intestine   open surgerywhen a surgeon makes one incision about  inches long in the patients abdomen the surgeon will locate the diseased or blocked section of small intestine and remove or repair that section the surgeon will reconnect the ends of the intestine
                
subtotal colectomy a subtotal colectomy also called a large bowel resection is surgery to remove part of a patients large intestine when a patient with crohns disease has a blockage a fistula or severe disease in the large intestine a surgeon may need to remove that section of intestine a surgeon can perform a subtotal colectomy by
                
 laparoscopic colectomywhen a surgeon makes several small halfinch incisions in the abdomen while watching the monitor the surgeon removes the diseased or blocked section of the large intestine the surgeon will reconnect the ends of the intestine   open surgerywhen a surgeon makes one incision about  to  inches long in the abdomen the surgeon will locate the diseased or blocked section of small intestine and remove that section the surgeon will reconnect the ends of the intestine
                
proctocolectomy and ileostomy a proctocolectomy is surgery to remove a patients entire colon and rectum an ileostomy is a stoma or opening in the abdomen that a surgeon creates from a part of the ileumthe last section of the small intestine the surgeon brings the end of the ileum through an opening in the patients abdomen and attaches it to the skin creating an opening outside of the patients body the stoma is about threefourths of an inch to a little less than  inches wide and is most often located in the lower part of the patients abdomen just below the beltline
                
a removable external collection pouch called an ostomy pouch or ostomy appliance connects to the stoma and collects intestinal contents outside the patients body intestinal contents pass through the stoma instead of passing through the anus the stoma has no muscle so it cannot control the flow of intestinal contents and the flow occurs whenever peristalsis occurs peristalsis is the movement of the organ walls that propels food and liquid through the gi tract
                
people who have this type of surgery will have the ileostomy for the rest of their lives"
information,what is are acid lipase disease ,"acid lipase disease or deficiency occurs when the enzyme needed to break down certain fats that are normally digested by the body is lacking or missing resulting in the toxic buildup of these fats in the bodys cells and tissues these fatty substances called lipids include fatty acids oils and cholesterol two rare lipid storage diseases are caused by the deficiency of the enzyme lysosomal acid lipase
                
wolmans disease also known as acid lipase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder marked by the buildup of cholesteryl esters normally a tranport form of cholesterol that brings nutrients into the cells and carries out waste and triglycerides a chemical form in which fats exist in the body infants with the disorder appear normal at birth but quickly develop progressive mental deterioration low muscle toneenlarged liver and grossly enlarged spleen gastrointestinal problems including an excessive amount of fats in the stools jaundice anemia vomiting and calcium deposits in the adrenal glands which causes them to harden both male and female infants are affected by the disorder
                
cholesteryl ester storage disease cesd is an extremely rare disorder that results from storage of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in cells in the blood and lymph and lymphoid tissue children develop an enlarged liver leading to cirrhosis and chronic liver failure before adulthood children may also develop calcium deposits in the adrenal glands and jaundice onset varies and the disorder may not be diagnosed until adulthood"

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with langerhans cell histiocytosis lch
                    different types of treatments are available for patients with lch some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment whenever possible patients should take part in a clinical trial in order to receive new types of treatment for lch some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the nci website choosing the most appropriate treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient family and health care team
                
                
                    children with lch should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood cancer
                    treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer the pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with lch and who specialize in certain areas of medicine these may include the following specialists            pediatrician      primary care physician      pediatric surgeon      pediatric hematologist      radiation oncologist      neurologist      endocrinologist      pediatric nurse specialist      rehabilitation specialist      psychologist      social worker
                
                
                    some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment for childhood cancer has ended
                    side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects late effects of cancer treatment may include the following          slow growth and development     hearing loss     bone tooth liver and lung problems     changes in mood feeling learning thinking or memory      second cancers such as leukemia retinoblastoma ewing sarcoma brain or liver cancer        some late effects may be treated or controlled it is important to talk with your childs doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information   many patients with multisystem lch have late effects caused by treatment or by the disease itself these patients often have longterm health problems that affect their quality of life
                
                
                    nine types of standard treatment are used
                    chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly onto the skin or into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy     chemotherapy agents given by injection or by mouth are used to treat lch chemotherapy agents include vinblastine cytarabine cladribine and methotrexate nitrogen mustard is a drug that is put directly on the skin to treat small lch lesions       surgery     surgery may be used to remove lch lesions and a small amount of nearby healthy tissue curettage is a type of surgery that uses a curette a sharp spoonshaped tool to scrape lch cells from bone    when there is severe liver or lung damage the entire organ may be removed and replaced with a healthy liver or lung from a donor        radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer in lch a special lamp may be used to send ultraviolet b uvb radiation toward lch skin lesions       photodynamic therapy     photodynamic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells a drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein the drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells for lch laser light is aimed at the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue patients who have photodynamic therapy should not spend too much time in the sun    in one type of photodynamic therapy called psoralen and ultraviolet a puva therapy the patient receives a drug called psoralen and then ultraviolet a radiation is directed to the skin       biologic therapy     biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy     interferon is a type of biologic therapy used to treat lch of the skin immunomodulators are also a type of biologic therapy thalidomide is an immunomodulator used to treat lch        targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to find and attack lch cells without harming normal cells imatinib mesylate is a type of targeted therapy called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor it stops blood stem cells from turning into dendritic cells that may become cancer cells other types of kinase inhibitors that affect cells with mutations changes in the braf gene such as dabrafenib and vemurafenib are being studied in clinical trials for lch     a family of genes called ras genes may cause cancer when they are mutated ras genes make proteins that are involved in cell signaling pathways cell growth and cell death ras pathway inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy being studied in clinical trials they block the actions of a mutated ras gene or its protein and may stop the growth of cancer        other drug therapy    other drugs used to treat lch include the following              steroid therapy such as prednisone is used to treat lch lesions       bisphosphonate therapy such as pamidronate zoledronate or alendronate is used to treat lch lesions of the bone and to lessen bone pain        nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids are drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen that are commonly used to decrease fever swelling pain and redness sometimes an nsaid called indomethacin is used to treat lch       retinoids such as isotretinoin are drugs related to vitamin a that can slow the growth of lch cells in the skin the retinoids are taken by mouth              stem cell transplant     stem cell transplant is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing bloodforming cells destroyed by the lch treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored after the chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the bodys blood cells        observation     observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    information about clinical trials is available from the nci website
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options for childhood lch and the treatment options for adult lch sections for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis clinical trials database
                
                
                    when treatment of lch stops new lesions may appear or old lesions may come back
                    many patients with lch get better with treatment however when treatment stops new lesions may appear or old lesions may come back this is called reactivation recurrence and may occur within one year after stopping treatment patients with multisystem disease are more likely to have a reactivation more common sites of reactivation are bone ears or skin diabetes insipidus also may develop less common sites of reactivation include lymph nodes bone marrow spleen liver or lung some patients may have more than one reactivation over a number of years
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose lch may be repeated this is to see how well the treatment is working and if there are any new lesions these tests may include           physical exam      neurological exam      ultrasound exam      mri      ct scan      pet scan        other tests that may be needed include           brain stem auditory evoked response baer test a test that measures the brains response to clicking sounds or certain tones       pulmonary function test pft a test to see how well the lungs are working it measures how much air the lungs can hold and how quickly air moves into and out of the lungs it also measures how much oxygen is used and how much carbon dioxide is given off during breathing this is also called a lung function test      chest xray an xray of the organs and bones inside the chest an xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film making a picture of areas inside the body        decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

information,what is are renal tubular acidosis ,"renal tubular acidosis rta is a disease that occurs when the kidneys fail to excrete acids into the urine which causes a persons blood to remain too acidic without proper treatment chronic acidity of the blood leads to growth retardation kidney stones bone disease chronic kidney disease and possibly total kidney failure
                
the bodys cells use chemical reactions to carry out tasks such as turning food into energy and repairing tissue these chemical reactions generate acids some acid in the blood is normal but too much acidacidosiscan disturb many bodily functions healthy kidneys help maintain acidbase balance by excreting acids into the urine and returning bicarbonatean alkaline or base substanceto the blood this reclaimed bicarbonate neutralizes much of the acid that is created when food is broken down in the body the movement of substances like bicarbonate between the blood and structures in the kidneys is called transport
                
one researcher has theorized that charles dickens may have been describing a child with rta in the character of tiny tim from a christmas carol tiny tims small stature malformed limbs and periods of weakness are all possible consequences of the chemical imbalance caused by  in the story tiny tim recovers when he receives medical treatment which would likely have included sodium bicarbonate and sodium citrate alkaline agents to neutralize acidic blood the good news is that medical treatment can indeed reverse the effects of rta"
inheritance,is down syndrome inherited ,most cases of down syndrome are not inherited when the condition is caused by trisomy  the chromosomal abnormality occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells in a parent the abnormality usually occurs in egg cells but it occasionally occurs in sperm cells an error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes for example an egg or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of chromosome  if one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child the child will have an extra chromosome  in each of the bodys cells  people with translocation down syndrome can inherit the condition from an unaffected parent the parent carries a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome  and another chromosome this rearrangement is called a balanced translocation no genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems however as this translocation is passed to the next generation it can become unbalanced people who inherit an unbalanced translocation involving chromosome  may have extra genetic material from chromosome  which causes down syndrome  like trisomy  mosaic down syndrome is not inherited it occurs as a random event during cell division early in fetal development as a result some of the bodys cells have the usual two copies of chromosome  and other cells have three copies of this chromosome
treatment,what are the treatments for ehlersdanlos syndrome vascular type ,how might ehlersdanlos syndrome vascular type be treated the treatment and management of ehlersdanlos syndrome eds vascular type is focused on relieving associated signs and symptoms and preventing serious complications for example people with eds vascular type have tissue fragility that puts them at high risk for rupture of arteries muscles and internal organs it is therefore important to seek immediate medical attention for any sudden unexplained pain as emergency surgery may be indicated pregnant women with eds vascular type should be followed by a maternalfetal specialists at a highrisk perinatal center periodic screening may be recommended to diagnose aneurysms or other problems that may not be associated with obvious symptoms people with the eds vascular type should also minimize risk of injury by avoiding contact sports heavy lifting and weight training elective surgery is also discouraged genereviews web site offers more specific information about the treatment and management of eds vascular type please click on the link to access this resource please speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your personal medical management plan

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to stevensjohnson syndrometoxic epidermal necrolysis ,several genetic changes have been found to increase the risk of sjsten in response to triggering factors such as medications most of these changes occur in genes that are involved in the normal function of the immune system  the genetic variations most strongly associated with sjsten occur in the hlab gene this gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen hla complex the hla complex helps the immune system distinguish the bodys own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria the hlab gene has many different normal variations allowing each persons immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins certain variations in this gene occur much more often in people with sjsten than in people without the condition  studies suggest that the hlab gene variations associated with sjsten cause the immune system to react abnormally to certain medications in a process that is not well understood the drug causes immune cells called cytotoxic t cells and natural killer nk cells to release a substance called granulysin that destroys cells in the skin and mucous membranes the death of these cells causes the blistering and peeling that is characteristic of sjsten  variations in several other hla and nonhla genes have also been studied as potential risk factors for sjsten however most people with genetic variations that increase the risk of sjsten never develop the disease even if they are exposed to drugs that can trigger it researchers believe that additional genetic and nongenetic factors many of which are unknown likely play a role in whether a particular individual develops sjsten  the drugs most frequently associated with sjsten include several medications that are used to treat seizures particularly carbamazepine lamotrigine and phenytoin allopurinol which is used to treat kidney stones and a form of arthritis called gout a class of antibiotic drugs called sulfonamides nevirapine which is used to treat hiv infection and a type of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids called oxicams other factors may also trigger sjsten in particular these skin reactions have occurred in people with an unusual form of pneumonia caused by infection with mycoplasma pneumoniae and in people with viral infections including cytomegalovirus researchers suspect that a combination of infections and drugs could contribute to the disease in some individuals in many cases no definitive trigger for an individuals sjsten is ever discovered
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to agerelated macular degeneration ,agerelated macular degeneration results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors many of these factors have been identified but some remain unknown  researchers have considered changes in many genes as possible risk factors for agerelated macular degeneration the beststudied of these genes are involved in a part of the bodys immune response known as the complement system this system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses trigger inflammation and remove debris from cells and tissues genetic changes in and around several complement system genes including the cfh gene contribute to a persons risk of developing agerelated macular degeneration it is unclear how these genetic changes are related to the retinal damage and vision loss characteristic of this condition  changes on the long q arm of chromosome  in a region known as  are also associated with an increased risk of agerelated macular degeneration the  region contains two genes of interest  and  changes in both genes have been studied as possible risk factors for the disease however because the two genes are so close together it is difficult to tell which gene is associated with agerelated macular degeneration risk or whether increased risk results from variations in both genes  other genes that are associated with agerelated macular degeneration include genes involved in transporting and processing highdensity lipoprotein hdl also known as good cholesterol and genes that have been associated with other forms of macular disease  researchers have also examined nongenetic factors that contribute to the risk of agerelated macular degeneration age appears to be the most important risk factor the chance of developing the condition increases significantly as a person gets older smoking is another established risk factor for agerelated macular degeneration other factors that may increase the risk of this condition include high blood pressure heart disease a highfat diet or one that is low in certain nutrients such as antioxidants and zinc obesity and exposure to ultraviolet uv rays from sunlight however studies of these factors in agerelated macular degeneration have had conflicting results

inheritance,is supravalvular aortic stenosis inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder however some people who inherit the altered gene never develop features of svas this situation is known as reduced penetrance  in some cases a person inherits the mutation from one parent who has the mutation other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family
inheritance,is myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers inherited ,is myoclonic epilepsy associated with ragged red fibers genetic if so how is it inherited merrf is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial dna and is transmitted by maternal inheritance it is called maternal inheritance because a child inherits the great majority of their mitochondria from their mother through the egg   the centre for genetics education provides a detail description of maternal inheritance  the mother of an individual with merrf usually has a mitochondrial mutation and may or may not have symptoms  or an individual with merrf may have a mitochondrial mutation that just occurred in them called a de novo mutation  if the mother has the mitochondrial mutation all of her children will inherit the mutation and may or may not have symptoms  all of her daughters children will also inherit the mitochondrial mutation  her sons children are not at risk of inheriting the mutation
complications,what are the complications of foodborne illnesses ,"foodborne illnesses may lead to dehydration hemolytic uremic syndrome hus and other complications acute foodborne illnesses may also lead to chronicor long lastinghealth problems
                
dehydration
                
when someone does not drink enough fluids to replace those that are lost through vomiting and diarrhea dehydration can result when dehydrated the body lacks enough fluid and electrolytesminerals in salts including sodium potassium and chlorideto function properly infants children older adults and people with weak immune systems have the greatest risk of becoming dehydrated
                
signs of dehydration are
                
 excessive thirst   infrequent urination   darkcolored urine   lethargy dizziness or faintness
                
signs of dehydration in infants and young children are
                
 dry mouth and tongue   lack of tears when crying   no wet diapers for  hours or more   high fever   unusually cranky or drowsy behavior   sunken eyes cheeks or soft spot in the skull
                
also when people are dehydrated their skin does not flatten back to normal right away after being gently pinched and released
                
severe dehydration may require intravenous fluids and hospitalization untreated severe dehydration can cause serious health problems such as organ damage shock or comaa sleeplike state in which a person is not conscious
                
hus
                
hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare disease that mostly affects children younger than  years of age hus develops when e coli bacteria lodged in the digestive tract make toxins that enter the bloodstream the toxins start to destroy red blood cells which help the blood to clot and the lining of the blood vessels
                
in the united states e coli  infection is the most common cause of hus but infection with other strains of e coli other bacteria and viruses may also cause hus a recent study found that about  percent of people with e coli  infections developed hus children younger than age  have the highest risk but females and people age  and older also have increased 
                
symptoms of e coli  infection include diarrhea which may be bloody and abdominal pain often accompanied by nausea vomiting and fever up to a week after e coli symptoms appear symptoms of hus may develop including irritability paleness and decreased urination hus may lead to acute renal failure which is a sudden and temporary loss of kidney function hus may also affect other organs and the central nervous system most people who develop hus recover with treatment research shows that in the united states between  and  fewer than  percent of people who developed hus died of the disorder older adults had the highest mortality rateabout onethird of people age  and older who developed hus 
                
studies have shown that some children who recover from hus develop chronic complications including kidney problems high blood pressure and diabetes
                
other complications
                
some foodborne illnesses lead to other serious complications for example c botulinum and certain chemicals in fish and seafood can paralyze the muscles that control breathing l monocytogenes can cause spontaneous abortion or stillbirth in pregnant women
                
research suggests that acute foodborne illnesses may lead to chronic disorders including
                
 reactive arthritis a type of joint inflammation that usually affects the knees ankles or feet some people develop this disorder following foodborne illnesses caused by certain bacteria including c jejuni and salmonella reactive arthritis usually lasts fewer than  months but this condition may recur or become chronic    irritable bowel syndrome ibs a disorder of unknown cause that is associated with abdominal pain bloating and diarrhea or constipation or both foodborne illnesses caused by bacteria increase the risk of developing    guillainbarr syndrome a disorder characterized by muscle weakness or paralysis that begins in the lower body and progresses to the upper body this syndrome may occur after foodborne illnesses caused by bacteria most commonly c jejuni most people recover in  to

exams and tests,how to diagnose hematuria blood in the urine ,"hematuria is diagnosed with urinalysis which is testing of a urine sample the urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis for the test a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper called a dipstick into the urine patches on the dipstick change color when rbcs are present in urine when blood is visible in the urine or a dipstick test of the urine indicates the presence of rbcs a health care provider examines the urine with a microscope to make an initial diagnosis of hematuria the next step is to diagnose the cause of the hematuria
                
the health care provider will take a thorough medical history if the history suggests a cause that does not require treatment the urine should be tested again after  hours for the presence of rbcs if two of three urine samples show too many rbcs when viewed with a microscope more serious causes should be explored the health care provider may order one or more of the following tests
                
 urinalysis further testing of the urine may be done to check for problems that can cause hematuria such as infection kidney disease and cancer the presence of white blood cells signals a uti rbcs that are misshapen or clumped together to form little tubes called casts may indicate kidney disease large amounts of protein in the urine called proteinuria may also indicate kidney disease the urine can also be tested for the presence of cancer cells   blood test a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis a blood test can show the presence of high levels of creatinine a waste product of normal muscle breakdown which may indicate kidney disease   biopsy a biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope the biopsyis performed by a health care provider in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic the health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography ct scan to guide the biopsy needle into the kidney the kidney tissue is examined in a lab by a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases the test helps diagnose the type of kidney disease causing hematuria   cystoscopy cystoscopy is a procedure that uses a tubelike instrument to look inside the urethra and bladder cystoscopy is performed by a health care provider in the office an outpatient facility or a hospital with local anesthesia however in some cases sedation and regional or general anesthesia are needed cystoscopy may be used to look for cancer cells in the bladder particularly if cancer cells are found with urinalysis more information is provided in the niddk health topiccystoscopy and ureteroscopy    kidney imaging tests intravenous pyelogram ivp is an x ray of the urinary tract a special dye called contrast medium is injected into a vein in the persons arm travels through the body to the kidneys and makes urine visible on the x ray the contrast medium also shows any blockage in the urinary tract when a small mass is found with ivp another imaging test such as an ultrasound ct scan or magnetic resonance imaging mri can be used to further study the mass imaging tests are performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging anesthesia is not needed though light sedation may be used in some cases imaging tests may show a tumor a kidney or bladder stone an enlarged prostate or other blockage of the normal flow of urine more information is provided in the niddk health topic imaging of the urinary tract"
exams and tests,how to diagnose fanconi anemia ,"people who have fanconi anemia fa are born with the disorder they may or may not show signs or symptoms of it at birth for this reason fa isnt always diagnosed when a person is born in fact most people who have the disorder are diagnosed between the ages of  and  years
                
the tests used to diagnose fa depend on a persons age and symptoms in all cases medical and family histories are an important part of diagnosing fa however because fa has many of the same signs and symptoms as other diseases only genetic testing can confirm its diagnosis
                
specialists involved
                
a geneticist is a doctor or scientist who studies how genes work and how diseases and traits are passed from parents to children through genes
                
geneticists do genetic testing for fa they also can provide counseling about how fa is inherited and the types of prenatal before birth testing used to diagnose it
                
an obstetrician may detect birth defects linked to fa before your child is born an obstetrician is a doctor who specializes in providing care for pregnant women
                
after your child is born a pediatrician also can help find out whether your child has fa a pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in treating children and teens
                
a hematologist blood disease specialist also may help diagnose fa
                
family and medical histories
                
fa is an inherited disease some parents are aware that their family has a medical history of fa even if they dont have the disease
                
other parents especially if theyre fa carriers may not be aware of a family history of fa many parents may not know that fa can be passed from parents to children
                
knowing your family medical history can help your doctor diagnose whether you or your child has fa or another condition with similar symptoms
                
if your doctor thinks that you your siblings or your children have fa he or she may ask you detailed questions about
                
any personal or family history of anemia
                
any surgeries youve had related to the digestive system
                
any personal or family history of immune disorders
                
your appetite eating habits and any medicines you take
                
if you know your family has a history of fa or if your answers to your doctors questions suggest a possible diagnosis of fa your doctor will recommend further testing
                
diagnostic tests and procedures
                
the signs and symptoms of fa arent unique to the disease theyre also linked to many other diseases and conditions such as aplastic anemia for this reason genetic testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis of fa genetic tests for fa include the following
                
chromosome breakage test
                
this is the most common test for fa its available only in special laboratories labs it shows whether your chromosomes long chains of genes break more easily than normal
                
skin cells sometimes are used for the test usually though a small amount of blood is taken from a vein in your arm using a needle a technician combines some of the blood cells with certain chemicals
                
if you have fa the chromosomes in your blood sample break and rearrange when mixed with the test chemicals this doesnt happen in the cells of people who dont have fa
                
cytometric flow analysis
                
cytometric flow analysis or cfa is done in a lab this test examines how chemicals affect your chromosomes as your cells grow and divide skin cells are used for this test
                
a technician mixes the skin cells with chemicals that can cause the chromosomes in the cells to act abnormally if you have fa your cells are much more sensitive to these chemicals
                
the chromosomes in your skin cells will break at a high rate during the test this doesnt happen in the cells of people who dont have fa
                
mutation screening
                
a mutation is an abnormal change in a gene or genes geneticists and other specialists can examine your genes usually using a sample of your skin cells with special equipment and lab processes they can look for gene mutations that are linked to fa
                
diagnosing different age groups
                
before birth prenatal
                
if your family has a history of fa and you get pregnant your doctor may want to test you or your fetus for fa
                
two tests can be used to diagnose fa in a developing fetus amniocentesis amneosentesis and chorionic villus koreonik vilus sampling cvs both tests are done in a doctors office or hospital
                
amniocentesis is done  to  weeks after a pregnant womans last period a doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of fluid from the sac around the fetus a technician tests chromosomes chains of genes from the fluid sample to see whether they have faulty genes associated with fa
                
cvs is done  to  weeks after a pregnant womans last period a doctor inserts a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta the temporary organ that connects the fetus to the mother
                
the doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction the tissue sample is sent to a lab to be tested for genetic defects associated with fa
                
at birth
                
three out of four people who inherit fa are born with birth defects if your baby is born with certain birth defects your doctor may recommend genetic testing to confirm a diagnosis of fa
                
for more information about these defects go to what are the signs and symptoms of fanconi anemia
                
childhood and later
                
some people who have fa are not born with birth defects doctors may not diagnose them with the disorder until signs of bone marrow failure or cancer occur this usually happens within the first  years of life
                
signs of bone marrow failure most often begin between the ages of  and  years with  to  years as the most common ages however  percent of children who have fa arent diagnosed until after  years of age
                
if your bone marrow is failing you may have signs of aplastic anemia fa is one type of aplastic anemia
                
in aplastic anemia your bone marrow stops making or doesnt make enough of all three types of blood cells red blood cells white blood cells and platelets
                
aplastic anemia can be inherited or acquired after birth through exposure to chemicals radiation or medicines
                
doctors diagnose aplastic anemia using
                
family and medical histories and a physical exam
                
a complete blood count cbc to check the number size and condition of your red blood cells the cbc also checks numbers of white blood cells and platelets
                
a reticulocyte retikulosite count this test counts the number of new red blood cells in your blood to see whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the proper rate
                
bone marrow tests for a bone marrow aspiration a small amount of liquid bone marrow is removed and tested to see whether its making enough blood cells for a bone marrow biopsy a small amount of bone marrow tissue is removed and tested to see whether its making enough blood cells
                
if you or your child is diagnosed with aplastic anemia your doctor will want to find the cause if your doctor suspects you have fa he or she may recommend genetic testing

information,what is are optic atrophy  ,optic atrophy  is a condition that mainly affects vision but may include other features vision loss typically begins within the first decade of life severity varies widely among affected people from nearly normal vision to complete blindness even among members of the same family vision problems may include difficulty distinguishing colors progressive narrowing of the field of vision tunnel vision and an abnormally pale appearance pallor of the optic nerve additional less common abnormalities may include sensorineural hearing loss ataxia myopathy muscle disease and other neurological findings it is usually caused by mutations in the  gene although some individuals with optic atrophy  do not have identified mutations in this gene in which case the cause of the condition is unknown this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern but some cases result from a new mutation in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family treatment focuses on individual symptoms when possible
information,what is are depression ,everyone feels blue or sad now and then but these feelings dont usually last long and pass within a couple of days when a person has depression it interferes with daily life and normal functioning and causes pain for both the person with depression and those who care about him or her doctors call this condition depressive disorder or clinical depression depression in older adults important life changes that happen as we get older may cause feelings of uneasiness stress and sadness for instance the death of a loved one moving from work into retirement or dealing with a serious illness can leave people feeling sad or anxious after a period of adjustment many older adults can regain their emotional balance but others do not and may develop depression depression is a common problem among older adults but it is not a normal part of aging in fact studies show that most older adults feel satisfied with their lives despite having more physical ailments however when older adults do suffer from depression it may be overlooked because they may be less willing to talk about feelings of sadness or grief or they may show different less obvious symptoms and doctors may be less likely to suspect or spot it sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish grief from major depression grief after loss of a loved one is a normal reaction to the loss and generally does not require professional mental health treatment however grief that lasts for a very long time following a loss may require treatment test depression and suicide though it is widely believed that suicide more often affects young people suicide is a serious problem among older adults too  particularly among older men  and depression is usually a major contributing factor adults  and older have a suicide rate that is higher than the rate for the national population but there are some major differences between older men and women while suicide rates for older women are somewhat lower than those for young and middleaged women rates among men  and older are higher than those for younger men in fact white men age  and older have the highest suicide rate in the united states types of depression there are several types of depression the most common types are major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder  major depressive disorder also called major depression or clinical depression is characterized by a combination of symptoms that interfere with a persons ability to work sleep concentrate eat and enjoy activities he or she once liked major depression prevents a person from functioning normally an episode of major depression may occur only once in a persons lifetime but more often it recurs throughout a persons life    dysthymic disorder also called dysthymia is a less severe but more longlasting form of depression dysthymia is characterized by symptoms lasting two years or longer that keep a person from functioning normally or feeling well people with dysthymia may also experience one or more episodes of major depression during their lifetime  major depressive disorder also called major depression or clinical depression is characterized by a combination of symptoms that interfere with a persons ability to work sleep concentrate eat and enjoy activities he or she once liked major depression prevents a person from functioning normally an episode of major depression may occur only once in a persons lifetime but more often it recurs throughout a persons life dysthymic disorder also called dysthymia is a less severe but more longlasting form of depression dysthymia is characterized by symptoms lasting two years or longer that keep a person from functioning normally or feeling well people with dysthymia may also experience one or more episodes of major depression during their lifetime other types of depression include subsyndromal depression psychotic depression and bipolar depression  subsyndromal depression  is common among older adults it includes less severe but clear symptoms of depression that fall short of being major depression or dysthymia having subsyndromal depression may increase a persons risk of developing major depression   psychotic depression occurs when a person has severe depression plus some form of psychosis such as having disturbing false beliefs or a break with reality delusions or hearing or seeing upsetting things that others cannot hear or see hallucinations   bipolar depression also called manicdepressive illness is not as common as major depression or dysthymia bipolar disorder is characterized by cycling mood changesfrom extreme highs eg mania to extreme lows eg depression  subsyndromal depression  is common among older adults it includes less severe but clear symptoms of depression that fall short of being major depression or dysthymia having subsyndromal depression may increase a persons risk of developing major depression psychotic depression occurs when a person

treatment,what are the treatments for dermatitis herpetiformis skin manifestation of celiac disease for health care professionals ,"the sulfone dapsone can provide immediate relief of symptoms for patients who cannot tolerate dapsone sulfapyridine or sulfamethoxypyridazine may be used although these medications are less effective than dapsone a strict glutenfree diet is the only treatment for the underlying disease even with a glutenfree diet medication therapy may need to be continued from a few months to  years
                
dh can go into remission which is defined as absence of skin lesions and symptoms of dh for more than  years while not taking sulfones or other treatments and not adhering to a glutenfree diet cohort studies showing dh remission provide support for reducing sulfone therapy and weaning from a glutenfree diet in patients with wellcontrolled "

symptoms,what are the symptoms of restless legs syndrome ,"the four key signs of restless legs syndrome rls are
                
a strong urge to move your legs this urge often but not always occurs with unpleasant feelings in your legs when the disorder is severe you also may have the urge to move your arms
                
symptoms that start or get worse when youre inactive the urge to move increases when youre sitting still or lying down and resting
                
relief from moving movement especially walking helps relieve the unpleasant feelings
                
symptoms that start or get worse in the evening or at night
                
you must have all four of these signs to be diagnosed with rls
                
the urge to move
                
rls gets its name from the urge to move the legs when sitting or lying down this movement relieves the unpleasant feelings that rls sometimes causes typical movements are
                
pacing and walking
                
jiggling the legs
                
stretching and flexing
                
tossing and turning
                
rubbing the legs
                
unpleasant feelings
                
people who have rls describe the unpleasant feelings in their limbs as creeping crawling pulling itching tingling burning aching or electric shocks severe rls may cause painful feelings however the pain usually is more of an ache than a sharp stabbing pain
                
children may describe rls symptoms differently than adults in children the condition may occur with hyperactivity however its not fully known how the disorders are related
                
the unpleasant feelings from rls often occur in the lower legs calves but the feelings can occur at any place in the legs or feet they also can occur in the arms
                
the feelings seem to come from deep within the limbs rather than from the surface you usually will have the feelings in both legs however the feelings can occur in one leg move from one leg to the other or affect one leg more than the other
                
people who have mild symptoms may notice them only when theyre still or awake for a long time such as on a long airplane trip or while watching tv if they fall asleep quickly they may not have symptoms when lying down at night
                
the unpleasant feelings from rls arent the same as the leg cramps many people get at night leg cramps often are limited to certain muscle groups in the leg which you can feel tightening leg cramps cause more severe pain and require stretching the affected muscle for relief
                
sometimes arthritis or peripheral artery disease pad can cause pain or discomfort in the legs moving the limbs usually worsens the discomfort instead of relieving it
                
periodic limb movement in sleep
                
many people who have rls also have a condition called periodic limb movement in sleep plms plms causes your legs or arms to twitch or jerk about every  to  seconds during sleep these movements cause you to wake up often and get less sleep
                
plms usually affects the legs but it also can affect the arms not everyone who has plms also has rls
                
related sleep problems
                
rls can make it hard to fall or stay asleep if rls disturbs your sleep you may feel very tired during the day
                
lack of sleep may make it hard for you to concentrate at school or work not enough sleep also can cause depression mood swings and other health problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure"

information,what is are blau syndrome ,blau syndrome is an inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the skin joints and eyes signs and symptoms begin in childhood usually before age   a form of skin inflammation called granulomatous dermatitis is typically the earliest sign of blau syndrome this skin condition causes a persistent rash that can be scaly or involve hard lumps nodules that can be felt under the skin the rash is usually found on the torso arms and legs  arthritis is another common feature of blau syndrome in affected individuals arthritis is characterized by inflammation of the lining of joints the synovium this inflammation known as synovitis is associated with swelling and joint pain synovitis usually begins in the joints of the hands feet wrists and ankles as the condition worsens it can restrict movement by decreasing the range of motion in many joints  most people with blau syndrome also develop uveitis which is swelling and inflammation of the middle layer of the eye the uvea the uvea includes the colored portion of the eye the iris and related tissues that underlie the white part of the eye the sclera uveitis can cause eye irritation and pain increased sensitivity to bright light photophobia and blurred vision other structures in the eye can also become inflamed including the outermost protective layer of the eye the conjunctiva the tear glands the specialized lightsensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye the retina and the nerve that carries information from the eye to the brain the optic nerve inflammation of any of these structures can lead to severe vision impairment or blindness  less commonly blau syndrome can affect other parts of the body including the liver kidneys brain blood vessels lungs and heart inflammation involving these organs and tissues can cause lifethreatening complications
frequency,how many people are affected by rotor syndrome ,rotor syndrome is a rare condition although its prevalence is unknown
information,what is are pigmentdispersion syndrome ,pigmentdispersion syndrome is an eye disorder that occurs when pigment granules that normally adhere to the back of the iris the colored part of the eye flake off into the clear fluid produced by the eye aqueous humor these pigment granules may flow towards the drainage canals of the eye slowly clogging them and raising the pressure within the eye intraocular pressure or iop this rise in eye pressure can cause damage to the optic nerve the nerve in the back of the eye that carries visual images to the brain if the optic nerve becomes damaged pigmentdispersion syndrome becomes pigmentary glaucoma this happens in about  of cases pigmentdispersion syndrome commonly presents between the second and fourth decades which is earlier than other types of glaucoma while men and women are affected in equal numbers men develop pigmentary glaucoma up to  times more often than women myopia nearsightedness appears to be an important risk factor in the development of pigmentdispersion syndrome and is present in up to  of affected individuals the condition may be sporadic or follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with reduced penetrance  at least one gene locus on chromosome  has been identified pigmentdispersion syndrome can be treated with eye drops or other medications in some cases laser surgery may be performed
inheritance,is dowlingdegos disease inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder
symptoms,what are the symptoms of childhood ependymoma ,the signs and symptoms of childhood ependymoma are not the same in every child signs and symptoms depend on the following          the childs age     where the tumor has formed        signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood ependymoma or by other conditions check with your childs doctor if your child has any of the following          frequent headaches      seizures     nausea and vomiting     pain or stiffness in the neck     loss of balance or trouble walking     weakness in the legs     blurry vision     back pain     a change in bowel function     trouble urinating      confusion or irritability
treatment,what are the treatments for neuroblastoma ,"key points
                     there are different types of treatment for patients with neuroblastoma      children with neuroblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer especially neuroblastoma     children who are treated for neuroblastoma may have late effects including an increased risk of second cancers      seven types of standard treatment are used          observation      surgery       radiation therapy       iodine  therapy      chemotherapy       highdose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell rescue       targeted therapy         new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials          immunotherapy      other drug therapy         patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with neuroblastoma
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with neuroblastoma some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment    because cancer in children is rare taking part in a clinical trial should be considered some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    children with neuroblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer especially neuroblastoma
                    treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer the pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with neuroblastoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine these may include the following specialists           pediatric surgeon     pediatric radiation oncologist      endocrinologist      neurologist     pediatric neuropathologist      neuroradiologist      pediatrician      pediatric nurse specialist      social worker      child life professional      psychologist
                
                
                    children who are treated for neuroblastoma may have late effects including an increased risk of second cancers
                    some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear years after cancer treatment has ended these are called late effects late effects of cancer treatment may include          physical problems     changes in mood feelings thinking learning or memory      second cancers new types of cancer          some late effects may be treated or controlled it is important that parents of children who are treated for neuroblastoma talk with their doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information
                
                
                    seven types of standard treatment are used
                    observation     observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change       surgery      surgery is used to treat neuroblastoma unless it has spread to other parts of the body depending on where the tumor is as much of the tumor as is safely possible will be removed if the tumor cannot be removed a biopsy may be done instead        radiation therapy      radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy               external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer       internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated and the childs risk group external radiation therapy is used to treat neuroblastoma       iodine  therapy     iodine  therapy is a treatment with radioactive iodine the radioactive iodine is given through an intravenous iv line and enters the bloodstream which carries radiation directly to tumor cells radioactive iodine collects in neuroblastoma cells and kills them with the radiation that is given off iodine  therapy is sometimes used to treat highrisk neuroblastoma that comes back after initial treatment       chemotherapy      chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated and the childs risk group    the use of two or more anticancer drugs is called combination chemotherapy    see drugs approved for neuroblastoma for more information       highdose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell rescue      highdose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell rescue is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by cancer treatment for highrisk neuroblastoma stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored after chemotherapy and radiation therapy are completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the bodys blood cells     maintenance therapy is given after highdose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell rescue to kill any cancer cells that may regrow and cause the disease to come back maintenance therapy is given for  months and includes the following treatments              isotretinoin a vitamin like drug that slows the cancers ability to make more cancer cells and changes how these cells look and act this drug is taken by mouth       dinutuximab a type of monoclonal antibody therapy that uses an antibody made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell dinutuximab identifies and attaches to a substance called  on the surface of neuroblastoma cells once dinutuximab attaches to the  a signal is sent to the immune system that a foreign substance has been found and needs to be killed then the bodys immune system kills the neuroblastoma cell dinutuximab is given by infusion it is a type of targeted therapy       granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor gmcsf a cytokine that helps make more immune system cells especially granulocytes and macrophages white blood cells which can attack and kill cancer cells         a type of immunotherapy that boosts the growth and activity of many immune cells especially lymphocytes a type of white blood cell lymphocytes can attack and kill cancer cells           see drugs approved for neuroblastoma for more information       targeted therapy    targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack cancer cells with less harm to normal cells there are different types of targeted therapy              tyrosine kinase inhibitors are smallmolecule drugs that go through the cell membrane and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide crizotinib is used to treat neuroblastoma that has come back after treatment       antibodydrug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug the monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells including cancer cells the drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibodydrug conjugate being studied to treat neuroblastoma that has come back after treatment
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website     immunotherapy     immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or biological therapy     vaccine therapy uses a substance to stimulate the immune system to destroy a tumor vaccine therapy is being studied to treat neuroblastoma that has come back after treatment       other drug therapy     lenalidomide is a type of angiogenesis inhibitor it prevents the growth of new blood vessels that are needed by a tumor to grow
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your childs condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

complete blood count
                
a complete blood count cbc measures the levels of red blood cells white blood cells and platelets in your blood for this test a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel usually in your arm
                
if you have thrombocytopenia the results of this test will show that your platelet count is low
                
blood smear
                
a blood smear is used to check the appearance of your platelets under a microscope for this test a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel usually in your arm
                
bone marrow tests
                
bone marrow tests check whether your bone marrow is healthy blood cells including platelets are made in your bone marrow the two bone marrow tests are aspiration aspihrashun and biopsy
                
bone marrow aspiration might be done to find out why your bone marrow isnt making enough blood cells for this test your doctor removes a sample of fluid bone marrow through a needle he or she examines the sample under a microscope to check for faulty cells
                
a bone marrow biopsy often is done right after an aspiration for this test your doctor removes a sample of bone marrow tissue through a needle he or she examines the tissue to check the number and types of cells in the bone marrow
                
other tests
                
if a bleeding problem is suspected you may need other blood tests as well for example your doctor may recommend pt and ptt tests to see whether your blood is clotting properly
                
your doctor also may suggest an ultrasound to check your spleen an ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of your spleen this will allow your doctor to see whether your spleen is enlarged"

we dont yet completely understand the causes of lateonset ad but they probably include genetic environmental and lifestyle factors although the risk of developing ad increases with age ad and dementia symptoms are not a part of normal aging there are also some forms of dementia that arent related to brain diseases such as ad but are caused by systemic abnormalities such as metabolic syndrome in which the combination of high blood pressure high cholesterol and diabetes causes confusion and memory loss"

prevention,how to prevent parasites  toxocariasis also known as roundworm infection ,"controlling toxocara infection in dogs and cats will reduce the number of infectious eggs in the environment and reduce the risk of infection for people have your veterinarian treat your dogs and cats especially young animals regularly for worms this is especially important if your pets spend time outdoors and may become infected again
    
there are several things that you can do around your home to make you and your pets safer
    
      clean your pet’s living area at least once a week feces should be either buried or bagged and disposed of in the trash wash your hands after handling pet waste
      do not allow children to play in areas that are soiled with pet or other animal feces and cover sandboxes when not in use to make sure that animals do not get inside and contaminate them
      wash your hands with soap and warm water after playing with your pets or other animals after outdoor activities and before handling food
      teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection
      teach children that it is dangerous to eat dirt or soil
    
    
more on handwashing
    
toxocara eggs have a strong protective layer which makes the eggs able to survive in the environment for months or even years under the right conditions many common disinfectants are not effective against toxocara eggs but extreme heat has been shown to kill the eggs prompt removal of animal feces can help prevent infection since the eggs require  to  weeks to become infective once they are out of the animal"
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease ,mutations in the  gene also known as  cause nomid the  gene provides instructions for making a protein called cryopyrin  cryopyrin belongs to a family of proteins called nucleotidebinding domain and leucinerich repeat containing nlr proteins these proteins are involved in the immune system helping to regulate the process of inflammation inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair when this has been accomplished the body stops inhibits the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues  cryopyrin is involved in the assembly of a molecular complex called an inflammasome which helps trigger the inflammatory process researchers believe that  mutations that cause nomid result in a hyperactive cryopyrin protein and an inappropriate inflammatory response impairment of the bodys mechanisms for controlling inflammation results in the episodes of fever and widespread inflammatory damage to the bodys cells and tissues seen in nomid  in about  percent of individuals diagnosed with nomid no mutations in the  gene have been identified the cause of nomid in these individuals is unknown

information,what is are acromegaly ,"acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that results from too much growth hormone gh in the body the pituitary a small gland in the brain makes gh in acromegaly the pituitary produces excessive amounts of gh usually the excess gh comes from benign or noncancerous tumors on the pituitary these benign tumors are called adenomas
                
acromegaly is most often diagnosed in middleaged adults although symptoms can appear at any age if not treated acromegaly can result in serious illness and premature death acromegaly is treatable in most patients but because of its slow and often sneaky onset it often is not diagnosed early or correctly the most serious health consequences of acromegaly are type  diabetes high blood pressure increased risk of cardiovascular disease and arthritis patients with acromegaly are also at increased risk for colon polyps which may develop into colon cancer if not removed
                
when ghproducing tumors occur in childhood the disease that results is called gigantism rather than acromegaly a childs height is determined by the length of the socalled long bones in the legs in response to gh these bones grow in length at the growth platesareas near either end of the bone growth plates fuse after puberty so the excessive gh production in adults does not result in increased height however prolonged exposure to excess gh before the growth plates fuse causes increased growth of the long bones and thus increased height pediatricians may become concerned about this possibility if a childs growth rate suddenly and markedly increases beyond what would be predicted by previous growth and how tall the childs parents are"

treatment,what are the treatments for hypersensitivity pneumonitis ,"the best way to treat hypersensitivity pneumonitis hp is to avoid the antigen that caused it an antigen is a substance that your body reacts against such as molds dusts and chemicals
                
in acute shortterm hp symptoms usually go away once youre no longer in contact with the antigen in chronic ongoing hp you may need medicines to relieve your symptoms
                
people who have chronic hp may develop pulmonary fibrosis this is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time people who have this condition may need further treatment such as oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation rehab
                
avoiding antigens
                
once the antigen that caused the hp and its source are found you can take steps to avoid it if hp is caught early avoiding the antigen may be the only treatment you need
                
avoiding an antigen may be easier at home than at work for example if your pet bird moldy carpet or hot tub is the source of the antigen you can remove it from your home if your heating system is the source of the antigen you can have your system properly serviced
                
however if the antigen is at work you may need to talk with your supervisor about your condition and ways to protect yourself for example masks or personal respirators may help protect you from antigens in the air a personal respirator is a device that helps filter the air you breathe in
                
some people who have hp may need to move to a different home or change jobs to avoid antigens after hurricanes for example some people have to move from their homes to avoid molds that could harm their lungs however moving and changing jobs sometimes isnt possible
                
medicines and other treatments
                
if you have chronic hp your doctor may prescribe medicines called corticosteroids these medicines reduce lung inflammation prednisone is an example of a corticosteroid
                
longterm use of prednisone especially at high doses can cause serious side effects thus if your doctor prescribes this medicine he or she may reduce the dose over time
                
examples of side effects from corticosteroids are increased risk of infections high blood pressure high blood sugar and osteoporosis thinning of the skin and bones
                
people who develop pulmonary fibrosis may need medicines oxygen therapy andor pulmonary rehab pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time
                
if you smoke try to quit smoking can make hp symptoms worse and lead to other lung diseases talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit also try to avoid secondhand smoke"
inheritance,is jacobsen syndrome inherited ,most cases of jacobsen syndrome are not inherited they result from a chromosomal deletion that occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells eggs or sperm or in early fetal development affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family although they can pass the chromosome deletion to their children  between  and  percent of people with jacobsen syndrome inherit the chromosome abnormality from an unaffected parent in these cases the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation in which a segment from chromosome  has traded places with a segment from another chromosome in a balanced translocation no genetic material is gained or lost balanced translocations usually do not cause any health problems however they can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation  children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with some missing genetic material and some extra genetic material individuals with jacobsen syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the end of the long arm of chromosome  and have extra genetic material from another chromosome these chromosomal changes result in the health problems characteristic of this disorder

an ophthalmologist eye specialist
                
a urologist urinary tract and urogenital system specialist
                
diagnostic tests and procedures
                
many tests are used to diagnose vasculitis
                
blood tests
                
blood tests can show whether you have abnormal levels of certain blood cells and antibodies proteins in your blood these tests may look at
                
hemoglobin and hematocrit a low hemoglobin or hematocrit level suggests anemia a complication of vasculitis vasculitis can interfere with the bodys ability to make enough red blood cells vasculitis also can be linked to increased destruction of red blood cells
                
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies anca these antibodies are present in people who have certain types of vasculitis
                
erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr a high esr may be a sign of inflammation in the body
                
the amount of creactive protein crp in your blood a high crp level suggests inflammation
                
biopsy
                
a biopsy often is the best way for your doctor to make a firm diagnosis of vasculitis during a biopsy your doctor will take a small sample of your body tissue to study under a microscope he or she will take the tissue sample from a blood vessel or an organ
                
a pathologist will study the sample for signs of inflammation or tissue damage a pathologist is a doctor who specializes in identifying diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope
                
blood pressure
                
people who have vasculitis should have their blood pressure checked routinely vasculitis that damages the kidneys can cause high blood pressure
                
urinalysis
                
for this test youll provide a urine sample for analysis this test detects abnormal levels of protein or blood cells in the urine abnormal levels of these substances can be a sign of vasculitis affecting the kidneys
                
ekg electrocardiogram
                
an ekg is a simple painless test that records the hearts electrical activity you might have this test to show whether vasculitis is affecting your heart
                
echocardiography
                
echocardiography is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart the test gives information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working
                
chest x ray
                
a chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest such as your heart lungs and blood vessels abnormal chest xray results may show whether vasculitis is affecting your lungs or your large arteries such as the aorta or the pulmonary arteries
                
lung function tests
                
lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out how fast you can breathe air out and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood
                
lung function tests can help your doctor find out whether airflow into and out of your lungs is restricted or blocked
                
abdominal ultrasound
                
an abdominal ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the organs and structures in your abdomen the picture may show whether vasculitis is affecting your abdominal organs
                
computed tomography scan
                
a computed tomography tomograhfee scan or ct scan is a type of x ray that creates more detailed pictures of your internal organs than a standard x ray the results from this test can show whether you have a type of vasculitis that affects your abdominal organs or blood vessels
                
magnetic resonance imaging
                
a magnetic resonance imaging mri test uses radio waves magnets and a computer to create detailed pictures of your internal organs
                
other advanced imaging techniques
                
several new imaging techniques are now being used to help diagnose vasculitis duplex ultrasonography combines an image of the structure of the blood vessel with a color image of the blood flow through that vein or artery  positron emission tomography fdgpet identifies areas that show higher glucose metabolism leading to problems in the blood vessels
                
angiography
                
angiography anjeeografee is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show blood flowing through your blood vessels
                
the dye is injected into your bloodstream special xray pictures are taken while the dye flows through your blood vessels the dye helps highlight the vessels on the xray pictures
                
doctors use angiography to help find out whether blood vessels are narrowed swollen deformed or blocked"
causes,what causes polycythemia vera ,"primary polycythemia
                
polycythemia vera pv also is known as primary polycythemia a mutation or change in the bodys  gene is the main cause of pv the  gene makes a protein that helps the body produce blood cells
                
what causes the change in the  gene isnt known pv generally isnt inheritedthat is passed from parents to children through genes however in some families the  gene may have a tendency to mutate other unknown genetic factors also may play a role in causing pv
                
secondary polycythemia
                
another type of polycythemia called secondary polycythemia isnt related to the  gene longterm exposure to low oxygen levels causes secondary polycythemia
                
a lack of oxygen over a long period can cause your body to make more of the hormone erythropoietin epo high levels of epo can prompt your body to make more red blood cells than normal this leads to thicker blood as seen in pv
                
people who have severe heart or lung disease may develop secondary polycythemia people who smoke spend long hours at high altitudes or are exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide where they work or live also are at risk
                
for example working in an underground parking garage or living in a home with a poorly vented fireplace or furnace can raise your risk for secondary polycythemia
                
rarely tumors can make and release epo or certain blood problems can cause the body to make more epo
                
sometimes doctors can cure secondary polycythemiait depends on whether the underlying cause can be stopped controlled or cured"

exams and tests,how to diagnose pancreatic cancer ,tests that examine the pancreas are used to detect find diagnose and stage pancreatic cancer pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed with tests and procedures that make pictures of the pancreas and the area around it the process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the pancreas is called staging tests and procedures to detect diagnose and stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time in order to plan treatment it is important to know the stage of the disease and whether or not the pancreatic cancer can be removed by surgery     the following tests and procedures may be used            physical exam and history  an exam of the body to check general signs of health including checking for signs of disease such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken       blood chemistry studies  a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances such as bilirubin released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body an unusual higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of disease        tumor marker test  a procedure in which a sample of blood urine or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances such as ca  and carcinoembryonic antigen cea made by organs tissues or tumor cells in the body certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body these are called tumor markers       mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri       ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography a spiral or helical ct scan makes a series of very detailed pictures of areas inside the body using an xray machine that scans the body in a spiral path        pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do a pet scan and ct scan may be done at the same time this is called a petct       abdominal ultrasound  an ultrasound exam used to make pictures of the inside of the abdomen the ultrasound transducer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen and directs highenergy sound waves ultrasound into the abdomen the sound waves bounce off the internal tissues and organs and make echoes the transducer receives the echoes and sends them to a computer which uses the echoes to make pictures called sonograms the picture can be printed to be looked at later       endoscopic ultrasound eus a procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body usually through the mouth or rectum an endoscope is a thin tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing a probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce highenergy sound waves ultrasound off internal tissues or organs and make echoes the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram this procedure is also called endosonography       endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp a procedure used to xray the ducts tubes that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine sometimes pancreatic cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile causing jaundice an endoscope a thin lighted tube is passed through the mouth esophagus and stomach into the first part of the small intestine a catheter a smaller tube is then inserted through the endoscope into the pancreatic ducts a dye is injected through the catheter into the ducts and an xray is taken if the ducts are blocked by a tumor a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it this tube or stent may be left in place to keep the duct open tissue samples may also be taken       percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography ptc a procedure used to xray the liver and bile ducts a thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an xray is taken if a blockage is found a thin flexible tube called a stent is sometimes left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body this test is done only if ercp cannot be done       laparoscopy  a surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease small incisions cuts are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope a thin lighted tube is inserted into one of the incisions the laparoscope may have an ultrasound probe at the end in order to bounce highenergy sound waves off internal organs such as the pancreas this is called laparoscopic ultrasound other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as taking tissue samples from the pancreas or a sample of fluid from the abdomen to check for cancer      biopsy the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer there are several ways to do a biopsy for pancreatic cancer a fine needle or a core needle may be inserted into the pancreas during an xray or ultrasound to remove cells tissue may also be removed during a laparoscopy

treatment,what are the treatments for intestinal pseudoobstruction ,"a health care provider will treat intestinal pseudoobstruction with nutritional support medications and in some cases decompression rarely a person will need surgery if an illness a medication or both cause intestinal pseudoobstruction a health care provider will treat the underlying illness stop the medication or do both
                
nutritional support
                
people with intestinal pseudoobstruction often need nutritional support to prevent malnutrition and weight loss enteral nutrition provides liquid food through a feeding tube inserted through the nose into the stomach or placed directly into the stomach or small intestine a health care provider inserts the feeding tube sometimes using x ray or endoscopy for guidance and teaches the person how to care for the tube after returning home enteral nutrition is sufficient for most people with intestinal pseudoobstruction in a severe case a person may need iv feeding also called parenteral nutrition which provides liquid food through a tube placed in a vein
                
enteral nutrition is possible because the intestinal lining is normal in most people with intestinal pseudoobstruction enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition because it has a much lower risk of complications
                
medications
                
a health care provider prescribes medications to treat the different symptoms and complications of intestinal pseudoobstruction such as
                
 antibiotics to treat bacterial infections   pain medication which should be used sparingly if at all because most pain medications delay intestinal transit   medication to make intestinal muscles contract   antinausea medications   antidiarrheal medications   laxatives
                
decompression
                
a person with acute colonic pseudoobstruction and a greatly enlarged colon who does not respond to medications may need a procedure called decompression to remove gas from the colon a gastroenterologist can perform the procedure in a hospital or an outpatient center the gastroenterologist may choose to decompress the colon by using colonoscopy during colonoscopy the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the colon through the anus a health care provider gives the person a light sedative and possibly pain medication to relax if the person requires longterm decompression the gastroenterologist also can decompress the colon through a surgical opening in the cecum in this case the health care provider gives the person local anesthesia
                
surgery
                
in severe cases of intestinal pseudoobstruction a person may need surgery to remove part of the intestine however surgery should be performed rarely if at all because intestinal pseudoobstruction is a generalized disorder that typically affects the entire intestine removing part of the intestine cannot cure the disease
                
a surgeona doctor who specializes in surgerywill perform the surgery at a hospital a person will need general anesthesia a few highly specialized treatment centers offer small intestine transplantation a health care provider may recommend small intestine transplantation when all other treatments have failed"
treatment,what are the treatments for parasites  scabies ,"suggested general guidelines 
  
    
   
  
it is important to remember that the first time a person gets scabies they usually have no symptoms during the first  to  weeks they are infested however they can still spread scabies during this time 
  
treatment should be given to both the infested person and to household members and sexual contacts particularly those who have had prolonged direct skintoskin contact with the infested person both sexual and close personal contacts who have had direct prolonged skintoskin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated all persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation scabies may sometimes be sexuallyacquired in adults but is rarely sexuallyacquired in children 
  
bedding clothing and towels used by infested persons or their household sexual and close contacts as defined above anytime during the three days before treatment should be decontaminated by washing in hot water and drying in a hot dryer by drycleaning or by sealing in a plastic bag for at least  hours scabies mites generally do not survive more than  to  days away from human skin 
  
use of insecticide sprays and fumigants is not recommended 
    
  medications used to treat scabies 
  
    
   
  
products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites some also kill mite eggs scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor’s prescription no “overthecounter” nonprescription products have been tested and approved to treat scabies 
  
scabicide should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes in addition when treating infants and young children scabicide also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face scalp and neck as well as the rest of their body the scabicide should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off clean clothing should be worn after treatment 
  
the instructions contained in the box or printed on the label always should be followed carefully always contact a doctor or pharmacist if unsure how to use a particular medicine 
  
because the symptoms of scabies are due to a hypersensitivity reaction allergy to mites and their feces scybala itching still may continue for several weeks after treatment even if all the mites and eggs are killed if itching still is present more than  to  weeks after treatment or if new burrows or pimplelike rash lesions continue to appear retreatment may be necessary 
  
skin sores that become infected should be treated with an appropriate antibiotic prescribed by a doctor"

causes,what causes bronchitis ,"acute bronchitis
                
infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis the same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis sometimes bacteria can cause the condition
                
certain substances can irritate your lungs and airways and raise your risk for acute bronchitis for example inhaling or being exposed to tobacco smoke dust fumes vapors or air pollution raises your risk for the condition these lung irritants also can make symptoms worse

treatment,what are the treatments for parasites  echinococcosis ,"in the past surgery was the only treatment for cystic echinococcal cysts chemotherapy cyst puncture and pair percutaneous aspiration injection of chemicals and reaspiration have been used to replace surgery as effective treatments for cystic echinococcosis however surgery remains the most effective treatment to remove the cyst and can lead to a complete cure some cysts are not causing any symptoms and are inactive those cysts often go away without any treatment
    
the treatment of alveolar echinococcosis is more difficult than cystic echinococcosis and usually requires radical surgery longterm chemotherapy or both

exams and tests,how to diagnose anemia ,"your doctor will diagnose anemia based on your medical and family histories a physical exam and results from tests and procedures
                
because anemia doesnt always cause symptoms your doctor may find out you have it while checking for another condition
                
medical and family histories
                
your doctor may ask whether you have any of the common signs or symptoms of anemia he or she also may ask whether youve had an illness or condition that could cause anemia
                
let your doctor know about any medicines you take what you typically eat your diet and whether you have family members who have anemia or a history of it
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will do a physical exam to find out how severe your anemia is and to check for possible causes he or she may
                
listen to your heart for a rapid or irregular heartbeat
                
listen to your lungs for rapid or uneven breathing
                
feel your abdomen to check the size of your liver and spleen
                
your doctor also may do a pelvic or rectal exam to check for common sources of blood loss
                
diagnostic tests and procedures
                
you may have various blood tests and other tests or procedures to find out what type of anemia you have and how severe it is
                
complete blood count
                
often the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count cbc the cbc measures many parts of your blood
                
the test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit heematohcrit levels hemoglobin is the ironrich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood a low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia
                
the normal range of these levels might be lower in certain racial and ethnic populations your doctor can explain your test results to you
                
the cbc also checks the number of red blood cells white blood cells and platelets in your blood abnormal results might be a sign of anemia another blood disorder an infection or another condition
                
finally the cbc looks at mean corpuscular korpuskyular volume mcv mcv is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells and a clue as to the cause of your anemia in irondeficiency anemia for example red blood cells usually are smaller than normal
                
other tests and procedures
                
if the cbc results show that you have anemia you may need other tests such as
                
hemoglobin electrophoresis elektroforesis this test looks at the different types of hemoglobin in your blood the test can help diagnose the type of anemia you have
                
a reticulocyte retikulosite count this test measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood the test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate
                
tests for the level of iron in your blood and body these tests include serum iron and serum ferritin tests transferrin level and total ironbinding capacity tests also measure iron levels
                
because anemia has many causes you also might be tested for conditions such as kidney failure lead poisoning in children and vitamin deficiencies lack of vitamins such as  and folic acid
                
if your doctor thinks that you have anemia due to internal bleeding he or she may suggest several tests to look for the source of the bleeding a test to check the stool for blood might be done in your doctors office or at home your doctor can give you a kit to help you get a sample at home he or she will tell you to bring the sample back to the office or send it to a laboratory
                
if blood is found in the stool you may have other tests to find the source of the bleeding one such test is endoscopy endoskope for this test a tube with a tiny camera is used to view the lining of the digestive tract
                
your doctor also may want to do bone marrow tests these tests show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough blood cells"

complications along with their signs and symptoms  aneurysms  these occur when an abnormal bulge forms in the wall of an artery aneurysms develop and grow for years without causing signs or symptoms until they rupture grow large enough to press on nearby body parts or block blood flow the signs and symptoms that develop depend on the location of the aneurysm   chronic kidney disease this disease occurs when blood vessels narrow in the kidneys possibly causing kidney failure   cognitive changes  research shows that over time higher blood pressure numbers can lead to cognitive changes signs and symptoms include memory loss difficulty finding words and losing focus during conversations   eye damage this condition occurs when blood vessels in the eyes burst or bleed signs and symptoms include vision changes or blindness   heart attack this occurs when the flow of oxygenrich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart doesnt get oxygen the most common warning symptoms of a heart attack are chest pain or discomfort upper body discomfort and shortness of breath   heart failure this condition occurs when the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs common signs and symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath or trouble breathing feeling tired and swelling in the ankles feet legs abdomen and veins in the neck   peripheral arterial disease this is a disease in which plaque builds up in leg arteries and affects blood flow in the legs when people have symptoms the most common are pain cramping numbness aching or heaviness in the legs feet and buttocks after walking or climbing stairs   stroke a stroke occurs when the flow of oxygenrich blood to a portion of the brain is blocked the symptoms of a stroke include sudden onset of weakness paralysis or numbness of the face arms or legs trouble speaking or understanding speech and trouble seeing  aneurysms  these occur when an abnormal bulge forms in the wall of an artery

is checked your health care provider usually takes  readings at several medical appointments to diagnose high blood pressure based on the results of your blood pressure test your health care provider will diagnose prehypertension or high blood pressure if your systolic or diastolic readings are consistently higher than  mmhg once your health care provider determines the severity of your blood pressure he or she can order additional tests to determine if your blood pressure is due to other conditions or medicines or if you have primary high blood pressure health care providers can use this information to develop your treatment plan some people have white coat hypertension this happens when blood pressure readings are only high when taken in a health care providers office compared with readings taken in any other location researchers believe stress which can occur during the medical appointment causes white coat hypertension preparing for the test a blood pressure test is easy and painless and can be done in a health care providers office or clinic to prepare for the test  dont drink coffee or smoke cigarettes for  minutes prior to the test    go to the bathroom before the test a full bladder can change the reading    sit for  minutes before the test dont drink coffee or smoke cigarettes for  minutes prior to the test go to the bathroom before the test a full bladder can change the reading sit for  minutes before the test to track blood pressure readings over a period of time the health care provider may ask you to come into the office on different days and at different times to take your blood pressure the health care provider also may ask you to check readings at home or at other locations that have blood pressure equipment and to keep a written log of all your results whenever you have an appointment with the health care provider be sure to bring your log of blood pressure readings ask the doctor or nurse to tell you your blood pressure reading in numbers and to explain what the numbers mean write down your numbers or ask the doctor or nurse to write them down for you write down your readings ask the doctor or nurse to tell you your blood pressure reading in numbers and to explain what the numbers mean write down your numbers or ask the doctor or nurse to write them down for you the wallet card on the right can be printed out and used to record your blood pressure numbers checking your own blood pressure you can also check your blood pressure at home with a home blood pressure measurement device or monitor it is important that the blood pressure cuff fits you properly and that you understand how to use the monitor a cuff that is too small for example can give you a reading that is higher than your actual blood pressure your doctor nurse or pharmacist can help you check the cuff size and teach you how to use it correctly you may also ask for their help in choosing the right blood pressure monitor for you blood pressure monitors can be bought at discount chain stores and drug stores when you are taking your blood pressure at home sit with your back supported and your feet flat on the floor rest your arm on a table at the level of your heart after a diagnosis if youre diagnosed with high blood pressure your doctor will prescribe treatment your blood pressure will be tested again to see how the treatment affects it once your blood pressure is under control youll still need treatment under control means that your blood pressure numbers are in the normal range your doctor will likely recommend routine blood pressure tests he or she can tell you how often you should be tested the sooner you find out about high blood pressure and treat it the better early treatment may help you avoid problems such as heart attack stroke and kidney failure see tips for talking with your doctor after you receive a medical diagnosis
information,what is are troyer syndrome ,troyer syndrome is one of more than  geneticallydistinct neurological disorders known collectively as the hereditary spastic paraplegias these disorders are characterized by their paramount feature of progressive muscle weakness and spasticity in the legs additional symptoms of troyer syndrome also called  include leg contractures difficulty walking speech disorders drooling atrophy of the hand muscles developmental delays fluctuating emotions and short stature onset is typically in early childhood and symptoms gradually worsen over time troyer syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder meaning that both parents must carry and pass on the defective gene that produces the illness that results from a mutation in the spastic paraplegia gene  located in chromosome  that results in loss of the spartin proteins the disease was first observed in amish families in ohio diagnosis is made by specialized genetic testing

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to  dyskinesia ,as its name suggests  dyskinesia is caused by mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenylate cyclase  this enzyme helps convert a molecule called adenosine triphosphate atp to another molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp atp is a molecule that supplies energy for cells activities including muscle contraction and camp is involved in signaling for many cellular functions some  gene mutations that cause  dyskinesia are thought to increase adenylate cyclase  enzyme activity and the level of camp within cells others prevent production of adenylate cyclase  it is unclear how either type of mutation leads to the abnormal movements that occur in this disorder
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to  hepatocerebral mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome ,as the condition name suggests mutations in the  gene cause  hepatocerebral mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome the protein produced from the  gene is located in the inner membrane of cell structures called mitochondria mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities including energy production chemical signaling and regulation of cell growth division and death mitochondria contain their own dna known as mitochondrial dna mtdna which is essential for the normal function of these structures it is likely that the  protein is involved in the maintenance of mtdna having an adequate amount of mtdna is essential for normal energy production within cells   gene mutations that cause  hepatocerebral mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome lead to production of a protein with impaired function one mutation causes all cases of navajo neurohepatopathy and results in the production of an unstable  protein that is quickly broken down a dysfunctional or absent  protein leads to problems with the maintenance of mtdna which can cause a reduction in the amount of mtdna known as mitochondrial dna depletion mitochondrial dna depletion impairs mitochondrial function in many of the bodys cells and tissues particularly the brain liver and other tissues that have high energy requirements reduced mitochondrial function in the liver and brain lead to the liver failure and neurological dysfunction associated with  hepatocerebral mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome researchers suggest that the less mtdna that is available in cells the more severe the features of navajo neurohepatopathy
information,what is are sitosterolemia ,sitosterolemia is a condition in which fatty substances lipids from vegetable oils nuts and other plantbased foods accumulate in the blood and tissues these lipids are called plant sterols or phytosterols sitosterol is one of several plant sterols that accumulate in this disorder with a blood level  to  times greater than normal cholesterol a similar fatty substance found in animal products is mildly to moderately elevated in many people with sitosterolemia cholesterol levels are particularly high in some affected children  plant sterols are not produced by the body they are taken in as components of foods signs and symptoms of sitosterolemia begin to appear early in life after foods containing plant sterols are introduced into the diet  an accumulation of fatty deposits on the artery walls atherosclerosis may occur by adolescence or early adulthood in people with sitosterolemia the deposits narrow the arteries and can eventually block blood flow increasing the chance of a heart attack stroke or sudden death  people with sitosterolemia typically develop small yellowish growths called xanthomas beginning in childhood the xanthomas consist of accumulated lipids and may be located anywhere on or just under the skin typically on the heels knees elbows and buttocks they may also occur in the bands that connect muscles to bones tendons including tendons of the hand and the tendon that connects the heel of the foot to the calf muscles the achilles tendon large xanthomas can cause pain difficulty with movement and cosmetic problems  joint stiffness and pain resulting from plant sterol deposits may also occur in individuals with sitosterolemia less often affected individuals have blood abnormalities occasionally the blood abnormalities are the only signs of the disorder the red blood cells may be broken down undergo hemolysis prematurely resulting in a shortage of red blood cells anemia this type of anemia is called hemolytic anemia affected individuals sometimes have abnormally shaped red blood cells called stomatocytes in addition the blood cells involved in clotting called platelets or thrombocytes may be abnormally large macrothrombocytopenia

causes,what causes myhre syndrome ,what causes myhre syndrome myhre syndrome is caused by mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in transmitting chemical signals from the cell surface to the nucleus this signaling pathway called the transforming growth factor beta tgf pathway allows the environment outside the cell to affect how the cell produces other proteins as part of this pathway the  protein interacts with other proteins to control the activity of particular genes these genes influence many areas of development some researchers believe that the  gene mutations that cause myhre syndrome impair the ability of the  protein to attach bind properly with the other proteins involved in the signaling pathway other studies have suggested that these mutations result in an abnormally stable  protein that remains active in the cell longer changes in  binding or availability may result in abnormal signaling in many cell types which affects development of several body systems and leads to the signs and symptoms of myhre syndrome
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to laron syndrome ,laron syndrome is caused by mutations in the ghr gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein called the growth hormone receptor the receptor is present on the outer membrane of cells throughout the body particularly liver cells as its name suggests the growth hormone receptor attaches binds to growth hormone the two proteins fit together like a key in a lock when growth hormone is bound to its receptor it triggers signaling that stimulates the growth and division of cells this signaling also leads to the production primarily by liver cells of another important growthpromoting hormone called insulinlike growth factor i igfi  growth hormone and igfi have a wide variety of effects on the growth and function of many parts of the body for example these hormones stimulate the growth and division of cells called chondrocytes which play a critical role in producing new bone tissue growth hormone and igfi also influence metabolism including how the body uses and stores carbohydrates proteins and fats from food  mutations in the ghr gene impair the receptors ability to bind to growth hormone or to trigger signaling within cells as a result even when growth hormone is available cells are unable to respond by producing igfi and stimulating growth and division the cells inability to react to growth hormone which is described as growth hormone insensitivity disrupts the normal growth and function of many different tissues short stature results when growth hormone cannot adequately stimulate the growth of bones changes in metabolism caused by insensitivity to growth hormone and the resulting shortage of igfi cause many of the other features of the condition including obesity  researchers are working to determine how mutations in the ghr gene may protect people with laron syndrome from developing cancer and type  diabetes studies suggest that insensitivity to growth hormone may help prevent the uncontrolled growth and division of cells that can lead to the development of cancerous tumors growth hormone insensitivity also appears to alter how the body responds to insulin which is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels resistance to the effects of insulin is a major risk factor for type  diabetes people with laron syndrome have the opposite situation an increased sensitivity to insulin which likely helps explain their reduced risk of this common disease
causes,what causes leber hereditary optic neuropathy ,what causes leber hereditary optic neuropathy lhon leber hereditary optic neuropathy is a condition related to changes in mitochondrial dna mutations in the    and  genes cause lhon these genes are contained in mitochondrial dna mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use although most dna is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus mitochondria also have a small amount of their own dna known as mitochondrial dna or mtdna the genes related to leber hereditary optic neuropathy each provide instructions for making a protein involved in normal mitochondrial function these proteins are part of a large enzyme complex in mitochondria that helps convert oxygen and simple sugars to energy mutations in any of the genes disrupt this process it remains unclear how these genetic changes cause the death of cells in the optic nerve and lead to the specific features of leber hereditary optic neuropathy click here to visit the genetic home reference web site to learn more about how mutations in these genes cause leber hereditary optic neuropathy
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to camuratiengelmann disease ,mutations in the  gene cause camuratiengelmann disease the  gene provides instructions for producing a protein called transforming growth factor   the  protein helps control the growth and division proliferation of cells the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions differentiation cell movement motility and the selfdestruction of cells apoptosis the  protein is found throughout the body and plays a role in development before birth the formation of blood vessels the regulation of muscle tissue and body fat development wound healing and immune system function  is particularly abundant in tissues that make up the skeleton where it helps regulate bone growth and in the intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells the extracellular matrix  within cells the  protein is turned off inactive until it receives a chemical signal to become active the  gene mutations that cause camuratiengelmann disease result in the production of a  protein that is always turned on active overactive  proteins lead to increased bone density and decreased body fat and muscle tissue contributing to the signs and symptoms of camuratiengelmann disease  some individuals with camuratiengelmann disease do not have identified mutations in the  gene in these cases the cause of the condition is unknown
information,what is are frontotemporal dementia ,frontotemporal dementia ftd describes a clinical syndrome associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal anterior lobes of the brain originally known as picks disease the name and classification of ftd has been a topic of discussion for over a century the current designation of the syndrome groups together picks disease primary progressive aphasia and semantic dementia as ftd some doctors propose adding corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy to ftd and calling the group pick complex these designations will continue to be debated as it is defined today the symptoms of ftd fall into two clinical patterns that involve either  changes in behavior or  problems with language the first type features behavior that can be either impulsive disinhibited or bored and listless apathetic and includes inappropriate social behavior lack of social tact lack of empathy distractability loss of insight into the behaviors of oneself and others an increased interest in sex changes in food preferences agitation or conversely blunted emotions neglect of personal hygiene repetitive or compulsive behavior and decreased energy and motivation the second type primarily features symptoms of language disturbance including difficulty making or understanding speech often in conjunction with the behavioral types symptoms spatial skills and memory remain intact there is a strong genetic component to the disease ftd often runs in families

inheritance,is familial dilated cardiomyopathy inherited ,familial dilated cardiomyopathy has different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved  in  to  percent of cases familial dilated cardiomyopathy is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder in most cases an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent however some people who inherit the altered gene never develop features of familial dilated cardiomyopathy this situation is known as reduced penetrance other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family  in rare instances this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition  in other rare cases this condition is inherited in an xlinked pattern in these cases the gene associated with this condition is located on the x chromosome which is one of the two sex chromosomes in females who have two x chromosomes a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell increases the risk of developing heart disease but females with such a mutation may not develop familial dilated cardiomyopathy in males who have only one x chromosome a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes familial dilated cardiomyopathy a characteristic of xlinked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass xlinked traits to their sons
exams and tests,how to diagnose ards ,"your doctor will diagnose ards based on your medical history a physical exam and test results
                
medical history
                
your doctor will ask whether you have or have recently had conditions that could lead to ards for a list of these conditions go to who is at risk for ards
                
your doctor also will ask whether you have heart problems such as heart failure heart failure can cause fluid to build up in your lungs
                
physical exam
                
ards may cause abnormal breathing sounds such as crackling your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to hear these sounds
                
he or she also will listen to your heart and look for signs of extra fluid in other parts of your body extra fluid may mean you have heart or kidney problems
                
your doctor will look for a bluish color on your skin and lips a bluish color means your blood has a low level of oxygen this is a possible sign of ards

eyes posterior embryotoxon is a condition in which an opaque ring is present in the cornea the transparent covering of the eyeball the abnormality is common in people with alagille syndrome though it usually does not affect vision
                
skeleton the most common skeletal defect in a person with alagille syndrome is when the shape of the vertebraebones of the spinegives the appearance of flying butterflies this defect known as butterfly vertebrae rarely causes medical problems or requires treatment
                
heart and blood vessels people with alagille syndrome may have the following signs and symptoms having to do with the heart and blood vessels
                
 heart murmuran extra or unusual sound heard during a heartbeat a heart murmur is the most common sign of alagille syndrome other than the general symptoms of liver  most people with alagille syndrome have a narrowing of the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the  this narrowing causes a murmur that can be heard with a stethoscope heart murmurs usually do not cause problems   heart walls and valve problems a small number of people with alagille syndrome have serious problems with the walls or valves of the heart these conditions may need treatment with medications or corrective surgery   blood vessel problems people with alagille syndrome may have abnormalities of the blood vessels in the head and neck this serious complication can lead to internal bleeding or stroke alagille syndrome can also cause narrowing or bulging of other blood vessels in the body
                
kidney disease a wide range of kidney diseases can occur in alagille syndrome the kidneys are two beanshaped organs each about the size of a fist that filter wastes and extra fluid from the blood some people have small kidneys or have cystsfluidfilled sacsin the kidneys kidney function can also decrease"
information,what is are thrombocythemia and thrombocytosis ,"thrombocythemia thrombosithemeah and thrombocytosis thrombositosis are conditions in which your blood has a higher than normal number of platelets platelets
                
platelets are blood cell fragments theyre made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells
                
platelets travel through your blood vessels and stick together clot clotting helps stop any bleeding that may occur if a blood vessel is damaged platelets also are called thrombocytes thrombosites because a blood clot also is called a thrombus
                
a normal platelet count ranges from  to  platelets per microliter of blood
                
overview
                
the term thrombocythemia is preferred when the cause of a high platelet count isnt known the condition sometimes is called primary or essential thrombocythemia
                
this condition occurs if faulty cells in the bone marrow make too many platelets bone marrow is the spongelike tissue inside the bones it contains stem cells that develop into red blood cells white blood cells and platelets what causes the bone marrow to make too many platelets often isnt known
                
with primary thrombocythemia a high platelet count may occur alone or with other blood cell disorders this condition isnt common
                
when another disease or condition causes a high platelet count the term thrombocytosis is preferred this condition often is called secondary or reactive thrombocytosis secondary thrombocytosis is more common than primary thrombocythemia
                
often a high platelet count doesnt cause signs or symptoms rarely serious or lifethreatening symptoms can develop such as blood clots and bleeding these symptoms are more likely to occur in people who have primary thrombocythemia
                
outlook
                
people who have primary thrombocythemia with no signs or symptoms dont need treatment as long as the condition remains stable
                
other people who have this condition may need medicines or procedures to treat it most people who have primary thrombocythemia will live a normal lifespan
                
treatment and outlook for secondary thrombocytosis depend on its underlying cause"
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to prothrombin thrombophilia ,prothrombin thrombophilia is caused by a particular mutation in the  gene the  gene plays a critical role in the formation of blood clots in response to injury the protein produced from the  gene prothrombin also called coagulation factor ii is the precursor to a protein called thrombin that initiates a series of chemical reactions in order to form a blood clot the particular mutation that causes prothrombin thrombophilia results in an overactive  gene that causes too much prothrombin to be produced an abundance of prothrombin leads to more thrombin which promotes the formation of blood clots  other factors also increase the risk of blood clots in people with prothrombin thrombophilia these factors include increasing age obesity trauma surgery smoking the use of oral contraceptives birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy and pregnancy the combination of prothrombin thrombophilia and mutations in other genes involved in blood clotting can also influence risk

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to metatropic dysplasia ,metatropic dysplasia is caused by mutations in the  gene which provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a calcium channel the  channel transports positively charged calcium atoms calcium ions across cell membranes and into cells the channel is found in many types of cells but little is known about its function studies suggest that it plays a role in the normal development of cartilage and bone this role would help explain why  gene mutations cause the skeletal abnormalities characteristic of metatropic dysplasia mutations in the  gene appear to overactivate the channel increasing the flow of calcium ions into cells however it remains unclear how changes in the activity of the calcium channel lead to the specific features of the condition
information,what is are carotid artery disease ,"carotid artery disease is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the carotid arteries you have two common carotid arteries one on each side of your neck they each divide into internal and external carotid arteries
                
the internal carotid arteries supply oxygenrich blood to your brain the external carotid arteries supply oxygenrich blood to your face scalp and neck
                
carotid arteries
                

                
carotid artery disease is serious because it can cause a stroke also called a brain attack a stroke occurs if blood flow to your brain is cut off
                
if blood flow is cut off for more than a few minutes the cells in your brain start to die this impairs the parts of the body that the brain cells control a stroke can cause lasting brain damage longterm disability such as vision or speech problems or paralysis an inability to move or death
                
overview
                
carotid artery disease is a major cause of stroke in the united states over time plaque hardens and narrows the arteries this may limit the flow of oxygenrich blood to your organs and other parts of your body
                
atherosclerosis can affect any artery in the body for example if plaque builds up in the coronary heart arteries a heart attack can occur if plaque builds up in the carotid arteries a stroke can occur
                
a stroke also can occur if blood clots form in the carotid arteries this can happen if the plaque in an artery cracks or ruptures blood cell fragments called platelets platelets stick to the site of the injury and may clump together to form blood clots blood clots can partly or fully block a carotid artery
                
a piece of plaque or a blood clot also can break away from the wall of the carotid artery the plaque or clot can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of the brains smaller arteries this can block blood flow in the artery and cause a stroke
                
carotid artery disease may not cause signs or symptoms until the carotid arteries are severely narrowed or blocked for some people a stroke is the first sign of the disease
                
outlook
                
carotid artery disease is a major cause of stroke in the united states other conditions such as certain heart problems and bleeding in the brain also can cause strokeslifestyle changes medicines and medical procedures can help prevent or treat carotid artery disease and may reduce the risk of stroke
                
if you think youre having a stroke you need urgent treatment call  right away if you have symptoms of a stroke do not drive yourself to the hospitalyou have the best chance for full recovery if treatment to open a blocked artery is given within  hours of symptom onset the sooner treatment occurs the better your chances of recovery"
exams and tests,how to diagnose chromosome  syndrome ,how is chromosome  syndrome diagnosed there are several different specialized tests that can be used to diagnose a chromosome  syndrome these include karyotype  a karyotype is a laboratory test that produces an image of a persons chromosomes this test can be used to diagnose large deletions fish  a laboratory technique that is used to detect and locate a specific dna sequence on a chromosome during fish a chromosome is exposed to a small dna sequence called a probe that has a fluorescent molecule attached to it the probe sequence binds to its corresponding sequence on the chromosome this test can be used in combination with karyotyping for deletions that are too small to be seen on karyotype alone however fish is only useful if the person ordering the test suspects there is a duplication of a specific region of  array cgh  a technology that detects deletions that are too small to be seen on karyotype

prevention,how to prevent aneurysm ,"the best way to prevent an aortic aneurysm is to avoid the factors that put you at higher risk for one you cant control all aortic aneurysm risk factors but lifestyle changes can help you lower some risks
                
for example if you smoke try to quit talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking also try to avoid secondhand smoke for more information about how to quit smoking go to the diseases and conditions index dci smoking and your heart article
                
another important lifestyle change is following a healthy diet a healthy diet includes a variety of fruits vegetables and whole grains it also includes lean meats poultry fish beans and fatfree or lowfat milk or milk products a healthy diet is low in saturated fat trans fat cholesterol sodium salt and added sugar
                
for more information about following a healthy diet go to the national heart lung and blood institutes nhlbis aim for a healthy weight web site your guide to a healthy heart and your guide to lowering your blood pressure with dash all of these resources include general information about healthy eating
                
be as physically active as you can talk with your doctor about the amounts and types of physical activity that are safe for you for more information about physical activity go to the dci physical activity and your heart article and the nhlbis your guide to physical activity and your heart
                
work with your doctor to control medical conditions such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol follow your treatment plans and take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes
                
screening for aneurysms
                
although you may not be able to prevent an aneurysm early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent rupture and dissection
                
aneurysms can develop and grow large before causing any signs or symptoms thus people who are at high risk for aneurysms may benefit from early routine screening
                
your doctor may recommend routine screening if youre
                
a man between the ages of  and  who has ever smoked
                
a man or woman between the ages of  and  who has a family history of aneurysms
                
if youre at risk but not in one of these highrisk groups ask your doctor whether screening will benefit you"
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to stormorken syndrome ,stormorken syndrome is caused by a mutation in the  gene the protein produced from this gene is involved in controlling the entry of positively charged calcium atoms calcium ions into cells the  protein recognizes when calcium ion levels are low and stimulates the flow of ions into the cell through special channels in the cell membrane called calciumrelease activated calcium crac channels the flow of calcium ions through crac channels triggers signaling within cells that helps control gene activity cell growth and division and immune function  the  gene mutation involved in stormorken syndrome leads to production of a  protein that is constantly turned on constitutively active which means it continually stimulates calcium ion entry through crac channels regardless of ion levels researchers suggest that the abnormal ion flow in platelets causes the cells to die earlier than usual leading to thrombocytopenia and bleeding problems in people with stormorken syndrome it is unknown how constitutively active  leads to the other features of the disorder

treatment,what are the treatments for lip and oral cavity cancer ,"key points
                     there are different types of treatment for patients with lip and oral cavity cancer      patients with lip and oral cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are expert in treating head and neck cancer     two types of standard treatment are used          surgery       radiation therapy          new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials           chemotherapy       hyperfractionated radiation therapy      hyperthermia therapy         patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with lip and oral cavity cancer
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with lip and oral cavity cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    patients with lip and oral cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are expert in treating head and neck cancer
                    treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer because the lips and oral cavity are important for breathing eating and talking patients may need special help adjusting to the side effects of the cancer and its treatment the medical oncologist may refer the patient to other health professionals with special training in the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer these include the following          head and neck surgeon      radiation oncologist      dentist      speech therapist      dietitian      psychologist      rehabilitation specialist      plastic surgeon
                
                
                    two types of standard treatment are used
                    surgery      surgery removing the cancer in an operation is a common treatment for all stages of lip and oral cavity cancer surgery may include the following              wide local excision removal of the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it if cancer has spread into bone surgery may include removal of the involved bone tissue        neck dissection removal of lymph nodes and other tissues in the neck this is done when cancer may have spread from the lip and oral cavity       plastic surgery an operation that restores or improves the appearance of parts of the body dental implants a skin graft or other plastic surgery may be needed to repair parts of the mouth throat or neck after removal of large tumors           even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy       radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy              external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer        internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat lip and oral cavity cancer    radiation therapy may work better in patients who have stopped smoking before beginning treatment it is also important for patients to have a dental exam before radiation therapy begins so that existing problems can be treated
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website     chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated       hyperfractionated radiation therapy     hyperfractionated radiation therapy is radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into small doses and the treatments are given more than once a day        hyperthermia therapy     hyperthermia therapy is a treatment in which body tissue is heated above normal temperature to damage and kill cancer cells or to make cancer cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation and certain anticancer drugs
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

                    nine types of standard treatment are used
                    radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy              external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer       internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer            totalbody irradiation is a type of external radiation therapy that is given to the entire body it may be given before a stem cell transplant    the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat adult nonhodgkin lymphoma and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life    for pregnant women with nonhodgkin lymphoma radiation therapy should be given after delivery if possible to avoid any risk to the baby if treatment is needed right away pregnant women may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy however lead used to shield the baby may not protect it from scattered radiation that could possibly cause cancer in the future       chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid intrathecal chemotherapy an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs steroid drugs may be added to lessen inflammation and lower the bodys immune response    the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated     intrathecal chemotherapy may also be used in the treatment of lymphoma that first forms in the testicles or sinuses hollow areas around the nose diffuse large bcell lymphoma burkitt lymphoma lymphoblastic lymphoma and some aggressive tcell lymphomas it is given to lessen the chance that lymphoma cells will spread to the brain and spinal cord this is called cns prophylaxis     in pregnant women the baby is exposed to chemotherapy when the mother is treated and some anticancer drugs cause birth defects because anticancer drugs are passed to the baby through the mother both must be watched closely when chemotherapy is given    see drugs approved for nonhodgkin lymphoma for more information       immunotherapy     immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer     immunomodulators are a type of immunotherapy lenalidomide is an immunomodulator used to treat adult nonhodgkin lymphoma    see drugs approved for nonhodgkin lymphoma for more information       targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells monoclonal antibody therapy proteasome inhibitor therapy and kinase inhibitor therapy are types of targeted therapy used to treat adult nonhodgkin lymphoma    monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading they may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells rituximab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat many types of nonhodgkin lymphoma monoclonal antibodies that have been joined to radioactive material are called radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies yttrium y  tiuxetan is an example of a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion     proteasome inhibitor therapy blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells and may prevent the growth of tumors    kinase inhibitor therapy such as idelalisib blocks certain proteins which may help keep lymphoma cells from growing and may kill them it is used to treat indolent lymphoma ibrutinib a type of brutons tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is used to treat lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma    see drugs approved for nonhodgkin lymphoma for more information       plasmapheresis    if the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and affects circulation plasmapheresis is done to remove extra plasma and antibody proteins from the blood in this procedure blood is removed from the patient and sent through a machine that separates the plasma the liquid part of the blood from the blood cells the patients plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient the normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with donated plasma or a plasma replacement plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming        watchful waiting      watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change        antibiotic therapy     antibiotic therapy is a treatment that uses drugs to treat infections and cancer caused by bacteria and other microorganisms    see drugs approved for nonhodgkin lymphoma for more information       surgery     surgery may be used to remove the lymphoma in certain patients with indolent or aggressive nonhodgkin lymphoma    the type of surgery used depends on where the lymphoma formed in the body             local excision for certain patients with mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue malt lymphoma ptld and small bowel tcell lymphoma       splenectomy for patients with marginal zone lymphoma of the spleen           patients who have a heart lung liver kidney or pancreas transplant usually need to take drugs to suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives longterm immunosuppression after an organ transplant can cause a certain type of nonhodgkin lymphoma called posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder pltd    small bowel surgery is often needed to diagnose celiac disease in adults who develop a type of tcell lymphoma       stem cell transplant    stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy andor totalbody irradiation and then replacing bloodforming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient autologous transplant or a donor allogeneic transplant and are frozen and stored after the chemotherapy andor radiation therapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the bodys blood cells
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website     vaccine therapy     vaccine therapy is a type of biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy vaccine therapy can also be a type of targeted therapy
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

frequency,how many people are affected by lynch syndrome ,in the united states about  new cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed each year approximately  to  percent of these cancers are caused by lynch syndrome
symptoms,what are the symptoms of gas in the digestive tract ,"the most common symptoms of gas are burping passing gas bloating and abdominal pain or discomfort however not everyone experiences these symptoms
                
burping burping or belching once in a while especially during and after meals is normal however people who burp frequently may be swallowing too much air and releasing it before the air enters the stomach
                
some people who burp frequently may have an upper gi disorder such as gastroesophageal reflux diseasea chronic condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus people may believe that swallowing air and releasing it will relieve the discomfort and they may intentionally or unintentionally develop a habit of burping to relieve discomfort
                
passing gas passing gas around  to  times a day is  flatulence is excessive gas in the stomach or intestine that can cause bloating and flatus flatulence may be the result of problems digesting certain carbohydrates
                
bloating bloating is a feeling of fullness and swelling in the abdomen the area between the chest and hips problems digesting carbohydrates may cause increased gas and bloating however bloating is not always caused by too much gas bloating may result from diseases that affect how gas moves through the intestines such as rapid gastric emptying or from diseases that cause intestinal obstruction such as colon cancer people who have had many operations internal hernias or bands of internal scar tissue called adhesions may experience bloating
                
disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome ibs can affect how gas moves through the intestines or increase pain sensitivity in the intestines ibs is a functional gi disorder meaning that the symptoms are caused by changes in how the digestive tract works the most common symptoms of ibs are abdominal pain or discomfort often reported as cramping along with diarrhea constipation or both ibs may give a sensation of bloating because of increased sensitivity to normal amounts of gas
                
eating a lot of fatty food can delay stomach emptying and cause bloating and discomfort but not necessarily too much gas
                
abdominal pain and discomfort people may feel abdominal pain or discomfort when gas does not move through the intestines normally people with ibs may be more sensitive to gas and feel pain when gas is present in the intestines"
inheritance,is abdominal aortic aneurysm inherited ,is abdominal aortic aneurysm inherited abdominal aortic aneurysm aaa is thought to be a multifactorial condition meaning that one or more genes likely interact with environmental factors to cause the condition in some cases it may occur as part of an inherited syndrome having a family history of aaa increases the risk of developing the condition a genetic predisposition has been suspected since the first report of three brothers who had a ruptured aaa and additional families with multiple affected relatives have been reported in some cases it may be referred to as  familial abdominal aortic aneurysm a swedish survey reported that the relative risk of developing aaa for a firstdegree relative of a person with aaa was approximately double that of a person with no family history of aaa in another study having a family history increased the risk of having an aneurysm  the highest risk was among brothers older than age  in whom the prevalence was  while specific variations in dna polymorphisms are known or suspected to increase the risk for aaa no one gene is known to cause isolated aaa it can occur with some inherited disorders that are caused by mutations in a single gene such as marfan syndrome and ehlersdanlos syndrome vascular type however these more typically involve the thoracoabdominal aorta because the inheritance of aaa is complex it is not possible to predict whether a specific person will develop aaa people interested in learning more about the genetics of aaa and how their family history affects risks to specific family members should speak with a genetics professional

exams and tests,how to diagnose narcolepsy ,"it can take as long as  to  years after the first symptoms appear before narcolepsy is recognized and diagnosed this is because narcolepsy is fairly rare also many narcolepsy symptoms are like symptoms of other illnesses such as infections depression and sleep disorders
                
narcolepsy sometimes is mistaken for learning problems seizure disorders or laziness especially in schoolaged children and teens when narcolepsy symptoms are mild the disorder is even harder to diagnose
                
your doctor will diagnose narcolepsy based on your signs and symptoms your medical and family histories a physical exam and test results
                
signs and symptoms
                
tell your doctor about any signs and symptoms of narcolepsy that you have this is important because your doctor may not ask about them during a routine checkup
                
your doctor will want to know when you first had signs and symptoms and whether they bother your sleep or daily routine he or she also will want to know about your sleep habits and how you feel and act during the day
                
to help answer these questions you may want to keep a sleep diary for a few weeks keep a daily record of how easy it is to fall and stay asleep how much sleep you get at night and how alert you feel during the day
                
for a sample sleep diary go to the national heart lung and blood institutes your guide to healthy sleep
                
medical and family histories
                
your doctor may ask whether
                
youre affected by certain factors that can lead to narcolepsy examples of these factors include infections brain injuries and autoimmune disorders some research suggests that environmental toxins may play a role in triggering narcolepsy
                
you take medicines and which ones you take some medicines can cause daytime sleepiness thus your symptoms may be due to medicine not narcolepsy
                
you have symptoms of other sleep disorders that cause daytime sleepiness
                
you have relatives who have narcolepsy or who have signs or symptoms of the disorder
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will check you to see whether another condition is causing your symptoms for example infections certain thyroid diseases drug and alcohol use and other medical or sleep disorders may cause symptoms similar to those of narcolepsy
                
diagnostic tests
                
sleep studies
                
if your doctor thinks you have narcolepsy he or she will likely suggest that you see a sleep specialist this specialist may advise you to have sleep studies to find out more about your condition
                
sleep studies usually are done at a sleep center doctors use the results from two tests to diagnose narcolepsy these tests are a polysomnogram psg and a multiple sleep latency test mslt
                
polysomnogram you usually stay overnight at a sleep center for a psg the test records brain activity eye movements heart rate and blood pressure a psg can help find out whether you
                
fall asleep quickly
                
go into rapid eye movement rem sleep soon after falling asleep
                
wake up often during the night
                
multiple sleep latency test this daytime sleep study measures how sleepy you are its often done the day after a psg during the test youre asked to nap for  every  hours throughout the day you will nap a total of four or five times
                
a technician checks your brain activity during this time he or she notes how quickly you fall asleep and how long it takes you to reach various stages of sleep
                
an mslt finds out how quickly you fall asleep during the day after a full nights sleep it also shows whether you go into rem sleep soon after falling asleep
                
other tests
                
hypocretin test this test measures the level of hypocretin in the fluid that surrounds your spinal cord most people who have narcolepsy have low levels of hypocretin hypocretin is a chemical that helps promote wakefulness
                
to get a sample of spinal cord fluid a spinal tap also called a lumbar puncture is done for this procedure your doctor inserts a needle into your lower back area and then withdraws a sample of your spinal fluid"
prevention,how can hps be prevented for hantavirus ,"eliminate or minimize contact with rodents in your home workplace or campsite if rodents dont find that where you are is a good place for them to be then youre less likely to come into contact with them seal up holes and gaps in your home or garage place traps in and around your home to decrease rodent infestation clean up any easytoget food
  
recent research results show that many people who became ill with hps developed the disease after having been in frequent contact with rodents andor their droppings around a home or a workplace on the other hand many people who became ill reported that they had not seen rodents or rodent droppings at all therefore if you live in an area where the carrier rodents are known to live try to keep your home vacation place workplace or campsite clean
  
for more information on how you can prevent rodent infestations the following information is available on the cdc rodents site"

such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken        blood chemistry studies  a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances such as glucose sugar released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body an unusual higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of disease        chromogranin a test a test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of chromogranin a in the blood a higher than normal amount of chromogranin a and normal amounts of hormones such as gastrin insulin and glucagon can be a sign of a nonfunctional pancreatic net        abdominal ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the abdomen taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography       mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri       somatostatin receptor scintigraphy  a type of radionuclide scan that may be used to find small pancreatic nets a small amount of radioactive octreotide a hormone that attaches to tumors is injected into a vein and travels through the blood the radioactive octreotide attaches to the tumor and a special camera that detects radioactivity is used to show where the tumors are in the body this procedure is also called octreotide scan and srs        endoscopic ultrasound eus a procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body usually through the mouth or rectum an endoscope is a thin tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing a probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce highenergy sound waves ultrasound off internal tissues or organs and make echoes the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram this procedure is also called endosonography        endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp a procedure used to xray the ducts tubes that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine sometimes pancreatic cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile causing jaundice an endoscope is passed through the mouth esophagus and stomach into the first part of the small intestine an endoscope is a thin tubelike instrument with a light and a lens for viewing a catheter a smaller tube is then inserted through the endoscope into the pancreatic ducts a dye is injected through the catheter into the ducts and an xray is taken if the ducts are blocked by a tumor a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it this tube or stent may be left in place to keep the duct open tissue samples may also be taken and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer       angiogram  a procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood a contrast dye is injected into the blood vessel as the contrast dye moves through the blood vessel xrays are taken to see if there are any blockages        laparotomy  a surgical procedure in which an incision cut is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease the size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease       intraoperative ultrasound  a procedure that uses highenergy sound waves ultrasound to create images of internal organs or tissues during surgery a transducer placed directly on the organ or tissue is used to make the sound waves which create echoes the transducer receives the echoes and sends them to a computer which uses the echoes to make pictures called sonograms       biopsy  the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer there are several ways to do a biopsy for pancreatic nets cells may be removed using a fine or wide needle inserted into the pancreas during an xray or ultrasound tissue may also be removed during a laparoscopy a surgical incision made in the wall of the abdomen       bone scan  a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells in the bone a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the blood the radioactive material collects in bones where cancer cells have spread and is detected by a scanner
        			
        			
                    	other kinds of lab tests are used to check for the specific type of pancreatic nets
                    	the following tests and procedures may be used    gastrinoma            fasting serum gastrin test a test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of gastrin in the blood this test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least  hours conditions other than gastrinoma can cause an increase in the amount of gastrin in the blood      basal acid output test a test to measure the amount of acid made by the stomach the test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least  hours a tube is inserted through the nose or throat into the stomach the stomach contents are removed and four samples of gastric acid are removed through the tube these samples are used to find out the amount of gastric acid made during the test and the ph level of the gastric secretions       secretin stimulation test  if the basal acid output test result is not normal a secretin stimulation test may be done the tube is moved into the small intestine and samples are taken from the small intestine after a drug called secretin is injected secretin causes the small intestine to make acid when there is a gastrinoma the secretin causes an increase in how much gastric acid is made and the level of gastrin in the blood      somatostatin receptor scintigraphy a type of radionuclide scan that may be used to find small pancreatic nets a small amount of radioactive octreotide a hormone that attaches to tumors is injected into a vein and travels through the blood the radioactive octreotide attaches to the tumor and a special camera that detects radioactivity is used to show where the tumors are in the body this procedure is also called octreotide scan and srs         insulinoma            fasting serum glucose and insulin test a test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of glucose sugar and insulin in the blood the test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least  hours          glucagonoma            fasting serum glucagon test a test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of glucagon in the blood the test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least  hours          other tumor types           vipoma                serum vip vasoactive intestinal peptide test a test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of vip        blood chemistry studies a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body an unusual higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in vipoma there is a lower than normal amount of potassium       stool analysis  a stool sample is checked for a higher than normal sodium salt and potassium levels              somatostatinoma                fasting serum somatostatin test a test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of somatostatin in the blood the test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least  hours       somatostatin receptor scintigraphy a type of radionuclide scan that may be used to find small pancreatic nets a small amount of radioactive octreotide a hormone that attaches to tumors is injected into a vein and travels through the blood the radioactive octreotide attaches to the tumor and a special camera that detects radioactivity is used to show where the tumors are in the body this procedure is also called octreotide scan and srs"

treatment,what are the treatments for colon cancer ,"key points
                     there are different types of treatment for patients with colon cancer      six types of standard treatment are used          surgery      radiofrequency ablation      cryosurgery      chemotherapy      radiation therapy      targeted therapy         new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials      patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with colon cancer
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with colon cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    six types of standard treatment are used
                    surgery     surgery removing the cancer in an operation is the most common treatment for all stages of colon cancer a doctor may remove the cancer using one of the following types of surgery              local excision if the cancer is found at a very early stage the doctor may remove it without cutting through the abdominal wall instead the doctor may put a tube with a cutting tool through the rectum into the colon and cut the cancer out this is called a local excision if the cancer is found in a polyp a small bulging area of tissue the operation is called a polypectomy       resection of the colon with anastomosis if the cancer is larger the doctor will perform a partial colectomy removing the cancer and a small amount of healthy tissue around it the doctor may then perform an anastomosis sewing the healthy parts of the colon together the doctor will also usually remove lymph nodes near the colon and examine them under a microscope to see whether they contain cancer      resection of the colon with colostomy if the doctor is not able to sew the  ends of the colon back together a stoma an opening is made on the outside of the body for waste to pass through this procedure is called a colostomy a bag is placed around the stoma to collect the waste sometimes the colostomy is needed only until the lower colon has healed and then it can be reversed if the doctor needs to remove the entire lower colon however the colostomy may be permanent            even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy       radiofrequency ablation      radiofrequency ablation is the use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed in other cases the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen this is done in the hospital with general anesthesia       cryosurgery     cryosurgery is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue this type of treatment is also called cryotherapy       chemotherapy    chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy      chemoembolization of the hepatic artery may be used to treat cancer that has spread to the liver this involves blocking the hepatic artery the main artery that supplies blood to the liver and injecting anticancer drugs between the blockage and the liver the livers arteries then deliver the drugs throughout the liver only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body the blockage may be temporary or permanent depending on what is used to block the artery the liver continues to receive some blood from the hepatic portal vein which carries blood from the stomach and intestine    the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    see drugs approved for colon and rectal cancer for more information       radiation therapy    radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy              external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer       internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life       targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells     types of targeted therapies used in the treatment of colon cancer include the following              monoclonal antibodies monoclonal antibodies are made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion they may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells                    bevacizumab and ramucirumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor vegf this may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow         cetuximab and panitumumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor egfr on the surface of some types of cancer cells this may stop cancer cells from growing and dividing                  angiogenesis inhibitors angiogenesis inhibitors stop the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow                     zivaflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor trap that blocks an enzyme needed for the growth of new blood vessels in tumors         regorafenib is used to treat colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and has not gotten better with other treatment it blocks the action of certain proteins including vascular endothelial growth factor this may help keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them it may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow                      see drugs approved for colon and rectal cancer for more information
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    information about clinical trials is available from the nci website
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to essential pentosuria ,essential pentosuria is caused by mutations in the dcxr gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein called dicarbonyllxylulose reductase dcxr which plays multiple roles in the body one of its functions is to perform a chemical reaction that converts a sugar called lxylulose to a molecule called xylitol this reaction is one step in a process by which the body can use sugars for energy  dcxr gene mutations lead to the production of altered dcxr proteins that are quickly broken down without this protein lxylulose is not converted to xylitol and the excess sugar is released in the urine  while essential pentosuria is caused by genetic mutations some people develop a noninherited form of pentosuria if they eat excessive amounts of fruits high in lxylulose or another pentose called larabinose this form of the condition which disappears if the diet is changed is referred to as alimentary pentosuria studies show that some drugs can also cause a form of temporary pentosuria called druginduced pentosuria these noninherited forms of the condition also do not cause any health problems

                    different types of treatments are available for children with ewing sarcoma some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment   because cancer in children is rare taking part in a clinical trial should be considered some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    children with ewing sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children
                    treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer the pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with ewing sarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine these may include the following specialists           pediatrician      surgical oncologist or orthopedic oncologist      radiation oncologist      pediatric nurse specialist      social worker      rehabilitation specialist      psychologist
                
                
                    treatment for ewing sarcoma may cause side effects
                    for information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer see our side effects page    side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects late effects of cancer treatment may include the following           physical problems     changes in mood feelings thinking learning or memory      second cancers new types of cancer patients treated for ewing sarcoma have an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome there is also an increased risk of sarcoma in the area treated with radiation therapy        some late effects may be treated or controlled it is important to talk with your childs doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information
                
                
                    five types of standard treatment are used
                    chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    systemic chemotherapy is part of the treatment for all patients with ewing tumors it is often the first treatment given and lasts for about  to  months chemotherapy is often given to shrink the tumor before surgery or radiation therapy and to kill any tumor cells that may have spread to other parts of the body    see drugs approved for soft tissue sarcoma for more information       radiation therapy    radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy              external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer       internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           external radiation therapy is used to treat ewing sarcoma    radiation therapy is used when the tumor cannot be removed by surgery or when surgery to remove the tumor will affect important body functions or the way the child will look it may be used to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery it may also be used to treat any tumor that remains after surgery and tumors that have spread to other parts of the body       surgery    surgery is usually done to remove cancer that is left after chemotherapy or radiation therapy when possible the whole tumor is removed by surgery tissue and bone that are removed may be replaced with a graft which uses tissue and bone taken from another part of the patients body or a donor sometimes an implant such as artificial bone is used    even if the doctor removes all of the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be given after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left chemotherapy or radiation therapy given after surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy        targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells     monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used in the treatment of recurrent ewing sarcoma it is being studied for the treatment of metastatic ewing sarcoma monoclonal antibodies are made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion they may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells     new types of targeted therapy are being studied              kinase inhibitor therapy is another type of targeted therapy kinase inhibitors are drugs that block a protein needed for cancer cells to divide they are being studied in the treatment of recurrent ewing sarcoma        parp inhibitor therapy is another type of targeted therapy parp inhibitors are drugs that block dna repair and may cause cancer cells to die they are being studied in the treatment of recurrent ewing sarcoma              highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue     highdose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy to treat ewing sarcoma and then replacing blood forming cells destroyed by cancer treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored after chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the bodys blood cells chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is used to treat recurrent ewing sarcoma
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website     chimeric antigen receptor car tcell therapy     car tcell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patients t cells a type of immune system cell so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells t cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory the changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor car t cells the car t cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion the car t cells multiply in the patients blood and attack cancer cells car tcell therapy is being studied in the treatment of ewing sarcoma that has recurred
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your childs condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

information,what is are hereditary endotheliopathy retinopathy nephropathy and stroke ,hereditary endotheliopathy with retinopathy nephropathy and stroke herns is a rare genetic condition that affects the vascular endothelium the inner lining of the arteries and blood vessels specifically the small blood vessels of the brain microangiopathy retina vascular retinopathy and kidneys are affected signs and symptoms may include progressive adult onset vision loss psychiatric disturbances strokelike episodes neurologic decline and kidney disease herns is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner the term retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy rvcl has recently been adopted to include herns cerebroretinal vasculopathy crv and hereditary vascular retinopathy hvr historically these  conditions have been considered distinct genetic studies have shown that these  conditions are likely variations of rvcl and are caused by mutations in the  gene
causes,what causes congenital hepatic fibrosis ,what causes congenital hepatic fibrosis isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis is rare congenital hepatic fibrosis is usually associated with conditions known as hepatorenal fibrocystic diseases fcd that can also affect the kidneys examples of fcds include polycystic kidney disease pkd and nephronophthisis nphp fcds can be inherited as autosomal recessive  autosomal dominant  or xlinked recessive disorders
information,what is are obesity hypoventilation syndrome ,"obesity hypoventilation hipoventihlashun syndrome ohs is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people in ohs poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide hypoventilation and too little oxygen in the blood hypoxemia
                
ohs sometimes is called pickwickian syndrome
                
overview
                
to understand ohs it helps to understand how the lungs work when you breathe air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe the air then travels to your lungs air sacs these sacs are called alveoli alveeuhleye
                
small blood vessels called capillaries kapihlareees run through the walls of the air sacs when air reaches the air sacs oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries at the same time carbon dioxide moves from the capillaries into the air sacs this process is called gas exchange
                
in people who have ohs poor breathing prevents proper gas exchange as a result the level of carbon dioxide in the blood rises also the level of oxygen in the blood drops
                
these changes can lead to serious health problems such as leg edema edemah pulmonary hypertension pullmunary hipertenshun cor pulmonale pulmehnale and secondary erythrocytosis ehrithrositoesis if left untreated ohs can even be fatal
                
the cause of ohs isnt fully known researchers think that several factors may work together to cause the disorder
                
many people who have ohs also have obstructive sleep apnea obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder in which the airway collapses or is blocked during sleep this causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep
                
obstructive sleep apnea disrupts your sleep and causes you to feel very tired during the day for more information go to the health topics sleep apnea article
                
outlook
                
doctors treat ohs in a number of ways one way is with positive airway pressure pap machines which are used during sleep
                
pap therapy uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open your doctor might recommend cpap continuous positive airway pressure or bipap bilevel positive airway pressure
                
if your doctor prescribes pap therapy youll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a cpap or bipap machine the home equipment provider will help you select a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs
                
other treatments for ohs include ventilator ventilator support and medicines a ventilator is a machine that supports breathing
                
ohs occurs with obesity so your doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes such as following a healthy diet and being physically active
                
ohs can lead to other serious health problems so following your treatment plan is important your health care team home equipment provider and family can help you manage your treatment"

information,what is are impetigo ,impetigo is a skin infection caused by bacteria it is usually caused by staphylococcal staph bacteria but it can also be caused by streptococcal strep bacteria it is most common in children between the ages of two and six it usually starts when bacteria get into a break in the skin such as a cut scratch or insect bite     symptoms start with red or pimplelike sores surrounded by red skin these sores can be anywhere but usually they occur on your face arms and legs the sores fill with pus then break open after a few days and form a thick crust they are often itchy but scratching them can spread the sores     impetigo can spread by contact with sores or nasal discharge from an infected person you can treat impetigo with antibiotics     nih national institute of allergy and infectious diseases
information,what is are hajducheney syndrome ,hajducheney syndrome is a rare disorder that can affect many parts of the body particularly the bones loss of bone tissue from the hands and feet acroosteolysis is a characteristic feature of the condition the fingers and toes are short and broad and they may become shorter over time as bone at the tips continues to break down bone loss in the fingers can interfere with fine motor skills such as picking up small objects  bone abnormalities throughout the body are common in hajducheney syndrome affected individuals develop osteoporosis which causes the bones to be brittle and prone to fracture many affected individuals experience breakage compression fractures of the spinal bones vertebrae some also develop abnormal curvature of the spine scoliosis or kyphosis hajducheney syndrome also affects the shape and strength of the long bones in the arms and legs the abnormalities associated with this condition lead to short stature  hajducheney syndrome also causes abnormalities of the skull bones including the bones of the face the shape of the skull is often described as dolichocephalic which means it is elongated from back to front in many affected individuals the bone at the back of the skull bulges outward causing a bump called a prominent occiput distinctive facial features associated with this condition include widely spaced and downwardslanting eyes eyebrows that grow together in the middle synophrys lowset ears a sunken appearance of the middle of the face midface hypoplasia and a large space between the nose and upper lip a long philtrum some affected children are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate or with a high arched palate in affected adults the facial features are often described as coarse  other features of hajducheney syndrome found in some affected individuals include joint abnormalities particularly an unusually large range of joint movement hypermobility dental problems hearing loss a deep gravelly voice excess body hair recurrent infections in childhood heart defects and kidney abnormalities such as the growth of multiple fluidfilled cysts polycystic kidneys some people with this condition have delayed development in childhood but the delays are usually mild  the most serious complications of hajducheney syndrome which occur in about half of all affected individuals are abnormalities known as platybasia and basilar invagination platybasia is a flattening of the base of the skull caused by thinning and softening of the skull bones basilar invagination occurs when the softened bones allow part of the spine to protrude abnormally through the opening at the bottom of the skull pushing into the lower parts of the brain these abnormalities can lead to severe neurological problems including headaches abnormal vision and balance a buildup of fluid in the brain hydrocephalus abnormal breathing and sudden death  the signs and symptoms of hajducheney syndrome vary greatly among affected individuals even among members of the same family many of the disorders features such as acroosteolysis and some of the characteristic facial features are not present at birth but become apparent in childhood or later the risk of developing platybasia and basilar invagination also increases over time  the features of hajducheney syndrome overlap significantly with those of a condition called serpentine fibulapolycystic kidney syndrome sfpks although they used to be considered separate disorders researchers discovered that the two conditions are associated with mutations in the same gene based on these similarities many researchers now consider hajducheney syndrome and sfpks to be variants of the same condition

inheritance,is prion disease inherited ,familial forms of prion disease are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means one copy of the altered prnp gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder in most cases an affected person inherits the altered gene from one affected parent in some people familial forms of prion disease are caused by a new mutation in the gene that occurs during the formation of a parents reproductive cells eggs or sperm or in early embryonic development although such people do not have an affected parent they can pass the genetic change to their children  the sporadic acquired and iatrogenic forms of prion disease including kuru and variant creutzfeldtjakob disease are not inherited
considerations,what to do for hypothyroidism ,"experts recommend that people eat a balanced diet to obtain most nutrients more information about diet and nutrition can be found on the national agricultural library website at wwwnutritiongov
                
dietary supplements
                
iodine is an essential mineral for the thyroid however people with autoimmune thyroid disease may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine taking iodine drops or eating foods containing large amounts of iodinesuch as seaweed dulse or kelpmay cause or worsen hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism more information about iodine can be found in the national library of medicine fact sheet iodine in diet available at 
                
women need more iodine when they are pregnantabout  micrograms a day because the baby gets iodine from the mothers diet in the united states about  percent of pregnant women may not get enough iodine in their diet or through prenatal  choosing iodized salt salt supplemented with iodineover plain salt and prenatal vitamins containing iodine will ensure this need is met
                
to help ensure coordinated and safe care people should discuss their use of dietary supplements such as iodine with their health care provider tips for talking with health care providers are available through the national center for complementary and integrative health"
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to sotos syndrome ,mutations in the  gene are the primary cause of sotos syndrome accounting for up to  percent of cases other genetic causes of this condition have not been identified  the  gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions as a histone methyltransferase histone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify structural proteins called histones which attach bind to dna and give chromosomes their shape by adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones a process called methylation histone methyltransferases regulate the activity of certain genes and can turn them on and off as needed the  protein controls the activity of genes involved in normal growth and development although most of these genes have not been identified  genetic changes involving the  gene prevent one copy of the gene from producing any functional protein research suggests that a reduced amount of  protein disrupts the normal activity of genes involved in growth and development however it remains unclear exactly how a shortage of this protein during development leads to overgrowth learning disabilities and the other features of sotos syndrome
treatment,what are the treatments for holes in the heart ,"many holes in the heart dont need treatment but some do those that do often are repaired during infancy or early childhood sometimes adults are treated for holes in the heart if problems develop
                
the treatment your child receives depends on the type location and size of the hole other factors include your childs age size and general health
                
treating an atrial septal defect
                
if a child has an atrial septal defect asd routine checkups are done to see whether it closes on its own about half of all asds close on their own over time and about  percent close within the first year of life
                
your childs doctor will let you know how often your child should have checkups for an asd frequent checkups arent needed
                
if an asd requires treatment catheter or surgical procedures are used to close the hole doctors often decide to close asds in children who still have medium or largesized holes by the time theyre  to  years old
                
catheter procedure
                
until the early  surgery was the usual method for closing all asds now thanks to medical advances doctors can use catheter procedures to close secundum asds these are the most common type of asd
                
before a catheter procedure your child is given medicine so he or she will sleep and not feel any pain then the doctor inserts a catheter a thin flexible tube into a vein in the groin upper thigh he or she threads the tube to the hearts septum a device made up of two small disks or an umbrellalike device is attached to the catheter
                
when the catheter reaches the septum the device is pushed out of the catheter the device is placed so that it plugs the hole between the atria its secured in place and the catheter is withdrawn from the body
                
within  months normal tissue grows in and over the device the closure device does not need to be replaced as the child grows
                
doctors often use echocardiography echo transesophageal tranzihsofuhjeeul echo tee and coronary angiography anjeeograhfee to guide them in threading the catheter to the heart and closing the defect tee is a special type of echo that takes pictures of the heart through the esophagus the esophagus is the passage leading from the mouth to the stomach
                
catheter procedures are much easier on patients than surgery they involve only a needle puncture in the skin where the catheter is inserted this means that recovery is faster and easier
                
the outlook for children having this procedure is excellent closures are successful in more than  out of  patients with no major leakage rarely a defect is too large for catheter closure and surgery is needed
                
surgery
                
openheart surgery generally is done to repair primum or sinus venosus asds before the surgery your child is given medicine so he or she will sleep and not feel any pain
                
then the cardiac surgeon makes an incision cut in the chest to reach the asd he or she repairs the defect with a special patch that covers the hole a heartlung bypass machine is used during the surgery so the surgeon can open the heart the machine takes over the hearts pumping action and moves blood away from the heart
                
the outlook for children who have asd surgery is excellent on average children spend  to  days in the hospital before going home complications such as bleeding and infection are very rare
                
in some children the outer lining of the heart may become inflamed this condition is called pericarditis perikarditis the inflammation causes fluid to collect around the heart in the weeks after surgery medicine usually can treat this condition
                
while in the hospital your child will be given medicine as needed to reduce pain or anxiety the doctors and nurses at the hospital will teach you how to care for your child at home
                
they will talk about preventing blows to the chest as the incision heals limiting activity while your child recovers bathing scheduling ongoing care and deciding when your child can go back to his or her regular activities
                
treating a ventricular septal defect
                
doctors may choose to monitor children who have ventricular septal defects vsds but no symptoms of heart failure this means regular checkups and tests to see whether the defect closes on its own or gets smaller
                
more than half of vsds eventually close usually by the time children are in preschool your childs doctor will let you know how often your child needs checkups checkups may range from once a month to once every  or  years
                
if treatment for a vsd is required options include extra nutrition and surgery to close the vsd doctors also can use catheter procedures to close some vsds they may use this approach if surgery isnt possible or doesnt work more research is needed to find out the risks and benefits of using catheter procedures to treat vsds
                
extra nutrition
                
some infants who have vsds dont grow and develop or gain weight as they should these infants usually
                
have large vsds
                
are born too early
                
tire easily during feeding
                
doctors usually recommend extra nutrition or special feedings for these infants these feedings are highcalorie formulas or breast milk supplements that give babies extra nourishment
                
some infants need tube feeding a small tube is inserted into the mouth and moved down into the stomach food is given through the tube
                
tube feeding can add to or take the place of bottle feeding this treatment often is shortterm because a vsd that causes symptoms will likely require surgery
                
surgery
                
most doctors recommend surgery to close large vsds that are causing symptoms affecting the aortic valve or havent closed by the time children are  year old surgery may be needed earlier if
                
a child doesnt gain weight
                
medicines are needed to control the symptoms of heart failure
                
rarely mediumsized vsds that are causing enlarged heart chambers are treated with surgery after infancy however most vsds that require surgery are repaired in the first year of life doctors use openheart surgery and patches to close vsds"

stages,what are the stages of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma ,"key points
                     after childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has been diagnosed treatment is based in part on the stage of the cancer and sometimes it is based on whether all the cancer was removed by surgery      there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body     cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body     staging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is done in three parts     the staging system is based on the size of the tumor where it is in the body and whether it has spread to other parts of the body          stage       stage       stage       stage          the grouping system is based on whether the cancer has spread and whether all the cancer was removed by surgery          group i      group ii      group iii      group iv         the risk group is based on the staging system and the grouping system          lowrisk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma      intermediaterisk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma      highrisk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
                
                
                    after childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has been diagnosed treatment is based in part on the stage of the cancer and sometimes it is based on whether all the cancer was removed by surgery
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the tissue or to other parts of the body is called staging it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment the doctor will use results of the diagnostic tests to help find out the stage of the disease   treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is based in part on the stage and sometimes on the amount of cancer that remains after surgery to remove the tumor the pathologist will use a microscope to check the tissues removed during surgery including tissue samples from the edges of the areas where the cancer was removed and the lymph nodes this is done to see if all the cancer cells were taken out during the surgery
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body
                    cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood          tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas      lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body      blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body
                
                 
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood          lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body     blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if rhabdomyosarcoma spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually rhabdomyosarcoma cells the disease is metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma not lung cancer
                
                
                    staging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is done in three parts
                    childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is staged by using three different ways to describe the cancer          a staging system     a grouping system     a risk group
                
                
                    the staging system is based on the size of the tumor where it is in the body and whether it has spread to other parts of the body
                    stage     in stage  the tumor is any size may have spread to lymph nodes and is found in only one of the following favorable sites             eye or area around the eye      head and neck but not in the tissue next to the brain and spinal cord       gallbladder and bile ducts       ureters or urethra       testes ovary vagina or uterus            rhabdomyosarcoma that forms in a favorable site has a better prognosis if the site where cancer occurs is not one of the favorable sites listed above it is said to be an unfavorable site        stage     in stage  cancer is found in an unfavorable site any one area not described as favorable in stage  the tumor is no larger than  centimeters and has not spread to lymph nodes        stage     in stage  cancer is found in an unfavorable site any one area not described as favorable in stage  and one of the following is true              the tumor is no larger than  centimeters and cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes      the tumor is larger than  centimeters and cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes              stage     in stage  the tumor may be any size and cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes cancer has spread to distant parts of the body such as the lung bone marrow or bone
                
                
                    the grouping system is based on whether the cancer has spread and whether all the cancer was removed by surgery
                    group i     cancer was found only in the place where it started and it was completely removed by surgery tissue was taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed the tissue was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and no cancer cells were found       group ii    group ii is divided into groups iia iib and iic             iia cancer was removed by surgery but cancer cells were seen when the tissue taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed was viewed under a microscope by a pathologist      iib cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes and the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery      iic cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery and at least one of the following is true                   tissue taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen        the furthest lymph node from the tumor that was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen                         group iii     cancer was partly removed by biopsy or surgery but there is tumor remaining that can be seen with the eye        group iv     cancer had spread to distant parts of the body when the cancer was diagnosed             cancer cells are found by an imaging test or      there are cancer cells in the fluid around the brain spinal cord or lungs or in fluid in the abdomen or tumors are found in those areas
                
                
                    the risk group is based on the staging system and the grouping system
                    the risk group describes the chance that rhabdomyosarcoma will recur come back every child treated for rhabdomyosarcoma should receive chemotherapy to decrease the chance cancer will recur the type of anticancer drug dose and the number of treatments given depends on whether the child has lowrisk intermediaterisk or highrisk rhabdomyosarcoma    the following risk groups are used     lowrisk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    lowrisk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is one of the following             an embryonal tumor of any size that is found in a favorable site there may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen with or without a microscope the cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes the following areas are favorable sites                    eye or area around the eye        head or neck but not in the tissue near the ear nose sinuses or base of the skull         gallbladder and bile ducts         ureter or urethra         testes ovary vagina or uterus                  an embryonal tumor of any size that is not found in a favorable site there may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen only with a microscope the cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes              intermediaterisk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    intermediaterisk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is one of the following             an embryonal tumor of any size that is not found in one of the favorable sites listed above there is tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen with or without a microscope the cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes      an alveolar tumor of any size in a favorable or unfavorable site there may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen with or without a microscope the cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes              highrisk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    highrisk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may be the embryonal type or the alveolar type it may have spread to nearby lymph nodes and has spread to one or more of the following             other parts of the body that are not near where the tumor first formed       fluid around the brain or spinal cord       fluid in the lung or abdomen"

treatment,what are the treatments for what i need to know about crohns disease ,"treatment for crohns disease depends on
                
 where the disease is located in the gi tract   what problems you already have from the disease   what past treatments you have had for the disease
                
the goals of treatment are to
                
 decrease the inflammation   relieve symptoms such as abdominal pain diarrhea and rectal bleeding   correct nutritional problems
                
treatment may include
                
 medicines   surgery   eating diet and nutrition
                

                
medicines
                
one or more of the following medicines may be used to treat crohns disease
                
 antiinflammation medicines may be used first to treat your crohns disease these medicines help lower inflammation in the intestine and relieve the pain and diarrhea sometimes antiinflammation medicines cause side effects so you should talk with your health care provider about what to expect   steroids also help lower inflammation steroids are similar to natural chemicals in the body however steroids are used only for a short time because longterm use can lead to serious side effects   immune system suppressors azathioprine and  work by keeping your immune system from attacking harmless foreign substances immune system suppressors also cause side effects so you should talk with your health care provider about what to expect   biological therapies biological therapies are medicines that are given by an injection in the vein infliximab remicade or an injection in the skin adalimumab humira your health care provider may treat you with these medicines if others are not helping to decrease inflammation or if you have fistulas with abscesses the goals for using these medicines are to get you better keep you better and avoid longterm steroid use   antibiotics antibiotics are used to treat bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine caused by stricture fistulas or surgery for this common problem the doctor may prescribe one or more of the following antibiotics ampicillin sulfonamide cephalosporin tetracycline or metronidazole
                

                
 antidiarrheal medicines and fluid replacements diarrhea and abdominal cramps are often relieved when the inflammation improves but more medicine may be needed antidiarrheal medicines include diphenoxylate loperamide and codeine people with diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydrationloss of fluids from the body if diarrhea does not improve the person should see the doctor promptly for possible treatment with fluids given through a small tube inserted into an arm vein
                
surgery
                
some people with crohns disease need surgery if medicines are no longer working to control blockage fistulas abscesses and bleeding a surgeon performs the procedure in a hospital where you will receive medicine to make you sleep during the surgery
                
one or more of the following surgeries may be needed
                
 intestinal resection the surgeon removes the diseased section of intestine and puts the ends of the intestine back together   proctocolectomy proctocolectomy is surgery to remove the rectum and part or all of the colon an ileostomy is performed with a proctocolectomy   ileostomy ileostomy is an operation to create an openingcalled a stomafor the stool to exit the body when the ends of the intestine cannot be put back together to create a stoma an end of the intestine is brought out through a small opening made on the lower right part of the abdomen near the beltline the stoma is about the size of a quarter an ostomy pouch is worn outside the body over the stoma to collect waste and it is emptied several times a day your health care provider may refer you to an ostomy nursea specialist who cares for people with an ostomy pouch
                
surgery usually does not cure crohns disease forever sometimes you need to have more than one surgery because the disease returns next to where the intestine was removed because crohns disease can return after surgery you can talk with your health care provider and other patients to get as much information as possible before having surgery"

causes,what causes cystic fibrosis ,"a defect in the cftr gene causes cystic fibrosis cf this gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your bodys cells in people who have cf the gene makes a protein that doesnt work well this causes thick sticky mucus and very salty sweat
                
research suggests that the cftr protein also affects the body in other ways this may help explain other symptoms and complications of cf
                
more than a thousand known defects can affect the cftr gene the type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of cf other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease
                
how is cystic fibrosis inherited
                
every person inherits two cftr genesone from each parent children who inherit a faulty cftr gene from each parent will have cf
                
children who inherit one faulty cftr gene and one normal cftr gene are cf carriers cf carriers usually have no symptoms of cf and live normal lives however they can pass the faulty cftr gene to their children
                
the image below shows how two parents who are both cf carriers can pass the faulty cftr gene to their children
                
example of an inheritance pattern for cystic fibrosis"
inheritance,is multiple lentigines syndrome inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder
treatment,what are the treatments for thymoma and thymic carcinoma ,"key points
                     there are different types of treatment for patients with thymoma and thymic carcinoma     four types of standard treatment are used          surgery      radiation therapy      chemotherapy      hormone therapy         new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials      patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with thymoma and thymic carcinoma
                    different types of treatments are available for patients with thymoma and thymic carcinoma some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    four types of standard treatment are used
                    surgery     surgery to remove the tumor is the most common treatment of thymoma     even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy       radiation therapy    radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy              external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer       internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat thymoma and thymic carcinoma       chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    chemotherapy may be used to shrink the tumor before surgery or radiation therapy this is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy       hormone therapy     hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing hormones are substances produced by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow if tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach receptors drugs surgery or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working    hormone therapy with drugs called corticosteroids may be used to treat thymoma or thymic carcinoma
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

these changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs thus the pressure in the arteries rises causing ph
                
many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of ph
                
group  pulmonary arterial hypertension pah may have no known cause or the condition may be inherited inherited means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes
                
some diseases and conditions also can cause group  pah examples include hiv infection congenital heart disease and sickle cell disease also the use of street drugs such as cocaine and certain diet medicines can lead to pah
                
many diseases and conditions can cause groups  through  ph often called secondary ph including
                
mitral valve disease
                
lung diseases such as copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
                
sleep apnea
                
sarcoidosis

treatment,what are the treatments for hemolytic anemia ,"treatments for hemolytic anemia include blood transfusions medicines plasmapheresis plazmehfehresis surgery blood and marrow stem cell transplants and lifestyle changes
                
people who have mild hemolytic anemia may not need treatment as long as the condition doesnt worsen people who have severe hemolytic anemia usually need ongoing treatment severe hemolytic anemia can be fatal if its not properly treated
                
goals of treatment
                
the goals of treating hemolytic anemia include
                
reducing or stopping the destruction of red blood cells
                
increasing the red blood cell count to an acceptable level
                
treating the underlying cause of the condition
                
treatment will depend on the type cause and severity of the hemolytic anemia you have your doctor also will consider your age overall health and medical history
                
if you have an inherited form of hemolytic anemia its a lifelong condition that may require ongoing treatment if you have an acquired form of hemolytic anemia it may go away if its cause can be found and corrected
                
blood transfusions
                
blood transfusions are used to treat severe or lifethreatening hemolytic anemia
                
a blood transfusion is a common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous iv line in one of your blood vessels transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipients blood
                
for more information go to the health topics blood transfusion article
                
medicines
                
medicines can improve some types of hemolytic anemia especially autoimmune hemolytic anemia aiha corticosteroid medicines such as prednisone can stop your immune system from or limit its ability to make antibodies proteins against red blood cells
                
if you dont respond to corticosteroids your doctor may prescribe other medicines to suppress your immune system examples include the medicines rituximab and cyclosporine
                
if you have severe sickle cell anemia your doctor may recommend a medicine called hydroxyurea this medicine prompts your body to make fetal hemoglobin fetal hemoglobin is the type of hemoglobin that newborns have
                
in people who have sickle cell anemia fetal hemoglobin helps prevent red blood cells from sickling and improves anemia
                
plasmapheresis
                
plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood for this procedure blood is taken from your body using a needle inserted into a vein
                
the plasma which contains the antibodies is separated from the rest of the blood then plasma from a donor and the rest of the blood is put back in your body
                
this treatment may help if other treatments for immune hemolytic anemia dont work
                
surgery
                
some people who have hemolytic anemia may need surgery to remove their spleens the spleen is an organ in the abdomen a healthy spleen helps fight infection and filters out old or damaged blood cells
                
an enlarged or diseased spleen may remove more red blood cells than normal causing anemia removing the spleen can stop or reduce high rates of red blood cell destruction
                
blood and marrow stem cell transplant
                
in some types of hemolytic anemia such as thalassemias the bone marrow doesnt make enough healthy red blood cells the red blood cells it does make may be destroyed before their normal lifespan is over blood and marrow stem cell transplants may be used to treat these types of hemolytic anemia
                
a blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces damaged stem cells with healthy ones from another person a donor
                
during the transplant which is like a blood transfusion you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein once the stem cells are in your body they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells
                
for more information go to the health topics blood and marrow stem cell transplant article
                
lifestyle changes
                
if you have aiha with coldreactive antibodies try to avoid cold temperatures this can help prevent the breakdown of red blood cells its very important to protect your fingers toes and ears from the cold
                
to protect yourself you can
                
wear gloves or mittens when taking food out of the refrigerator or freezer
                
wear a hat scarf and a coat with snug cuffs during cold weather
                
turn down air conditioning or dress warmly while in airconditioned spaces
                
warm up the car before driving in cold weather
                
people born with  dehydrogenase  deficiency can avoid substances that may trigger anemia for example avoid fava beans naphthalene a substance found in some moth balls and certain medicines as your doctor advises"

susceptibility,who is at risk for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ,"key points
                    past treatment for cancer and certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having childhood all anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk    possible risk factors for all include the following          being exposed to xrays before birth     being exposed to radiation     past treatment with chemotherapy     having certain genetic conditions such as                 down syndrome        neurofibromatosis type         bloom syndrome        fanconi anemia        ataxiatelangiectasia        lifraumeni syndrome       constitutional mismatch repair deficiency mutations in certain genes that stop dna from repairing itself which leads to the growth of cancers at an early age              having certain changes in the chromosomes or genes
                       
                
                    risk groups
                     in childhood all risk groups are used to plan treatment     relapsed childhood all is cancer that has come back after it has been treated
                
                
                
                    in childhood all risk groups are used to plan treatment
                    there are three risk groups in childhood all they are described as          standard low risk includes children aged  to younger than  years who have a white blood cell count of less than  at the time of diagnosis     high risk includes children  years and older andor children who have a white blood cell count of  or more at the time of diagnosis     very high risk includes children younger than age  children with certain changes in the genes children who have a slow response to initial treatment and children who have signs of leukemia after the first  weeks of treatment        other factors that affect the risk group include the following          whether the leukemia cells began from b lymphocytes or t lymphocytes     whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the lymphocytes     how quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after initial treatment     whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid at the time of diagnosis        it is important to know the risk group in order to plan treatment children with highrisk or very highrisk all usually receive more anticancer drugs andor higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standardrisk all
                
                
                
                    relapsed childhood all is cancer that has come back after it has been treated
                    the leukemia may come back in the blood and bone marrow brain spinal cord testicles or other parts of the body    refractory childhood all is cancer that does not respond to treatment"
inheritance,is rippling muscle disease inherited ,rippling muscle disease is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern but it is occasionally inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern  autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of an altered  gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder in most cases an affected person has one parent with rippling muscle disease or another caveolinopathy rare cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of caveolinopathies in their family  autosomal recessive inheritance means that both copies of the  gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition people with autosomal recessive rippling muscle disease generally have more severe signs and symptoms than do people with the autosomal dominant form
inheritance,is spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition

 acarbose precose   metformin glucophage   miglitol glyset   pioglitazone actos   rosiglitazone avandia
                
however taking these pills along with other diabetes medicationsinsulin pills that increase insulin production or bothincreases the risk of hypoglycemia
                
in addition use of the following injectable medications can cause hypoglycemia
                
 pramlintide symlin which is used along with insulin   exenatide byetta which can cause hypoglycemia when used in combination with chlorpropamide glimepiride glipizide glyburide tolazamide and tolbutamide
                
more information about diabetes medications is provided in the niddk health topic what i need to know about diabetes medicines or by calling 
                
other causes of hypoglycemia
                
in people on insulin or pills that increase insulin production low blood glucose can be due to
                
 meals or snacks that are too small delayed or skipped   increased physical activity   alcoholic beverages"
information,what is are intestinal cancer ,your small intestine is part of your digestive system it is a long tube that connects your stomach to your large intestine intestinal cancer is rare but eating a highfat diet or having crohns disease celiac disease or a history of colonic polyps can increase your risk    possible signs of small intestine cancer include        abdominal pain     weight loss for no reason     blood in the stool     a lump in the abdomen       imaging tests that create pictures of the small intestine and the area around it can help diagnose intestinal cancer and show whether it has spread    surgery is the most common treatment additional options include chemotherapy radiation therapy or a combination    nih national cancer institute

stages,what are the stages of nasopharyngeal cancer ,"key points
                     after nasopharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the nasopharynx or to other parts of the body      there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body     cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body     the following stages are used for nasopharyngeal cancer          stage  carcinoma in situ      stage i      stage ii      stage iii      stage iv
                
                
                    after nasopharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the nasopharynx or to other parts of the body
                    the process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the nasopharynx or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment the results of the tests used to diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer are often also used to stage the disease see the general information section
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body
                    cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood          tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas      lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body      blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood          lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body     blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if nasopharyngeal cancer spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually nasopharyngeal cancer cells the disease is metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer not lung cancer
                
                
                    the following stages are used for nasopharyngeal cancer
                    stage  carcinoma in situ    in stage  abnormal cells are found in the lining of the nasopharynx these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue stage  is also called carcinoma in situ       stage i    in stage i cancer has formed and the cancer             is found in the nasopharynx only or      has spread from the nasopharynx to the oropharynx andor to the nasal cavity           the oropharynx is the middle part of the throat and includes the soft palate the base of the tongue and the tonsils        stage ii    in stage ii nasopharyngeal cancer the cancer             is found in the nasopharynx only or has spread from the nasopharynx to the oropharynx andor to the nasal cavity cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes on one side of the neck andor to lymph nodes behind the pharynx the affected lymph nodes are  centimeters or smaller or        is found in the parapharyngeal space cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes on one side of the neck andor to lymph nodes behind the pharynx the affected lymph nodes are  centimeters or smaller            the oropharynx is the middle part of the throat and includes the soft palate the base of the tongue and the tonsils the parapharyngeal space is a fatfilled triangular area near the pharynx between the base of the skull and the lower jaw       stage iii     in stage iii nasopharyngeal cancer the cancer             is found in the nasopharynx only or has spread from the nasopharynx to the oropharynx andor to the nasal cavity cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes on both sides of the neck the affected lymph nodes are  centimeters or smaller or       is found in the parapharyngeal space cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes on both sides of the neck the affected lymph nodes are  centimeters or smaller or       has spread to nearby bones or sinuses cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes on one or both sides of the neck andor to lymph nodes behind the pharynx the affected lymph nodes are  centimeters or smaller            the oropharynx is the middle part of the throat and includes the soft palate the base of the tongue and the tonsils the parapharyngeal space is a fatfilled triangular area near the pharynx between the base of the skull and the lower jaw       stage iv     stage iv nasopharyngeal cancer is divided into stages iva ivb and ivc              stage iva cancer has spread beyond the nasopharynx and may have spread to the cranial nerves the hypopharynx bottom part of the throat areas in and around the side of the skull or jawbone andor the bone around the eye cancer may also have spread to one or more lymph nodes on one or both sides of the neck andor to lymph nodes behind the pharynx the affected lymph nodes are  centimeters or smaller       stage ivb cancer has spread to lymph nodes between the collarbone and the top of the shoulder andor the affected lymph nodes are larger than  centimeters        stage ivc cancer has spread beyond nearby lymph nodes to other parts of the body"

treatment,what are the treatments for pernicious anemia ,"doctors treat pernicious anemia by replacing the missing vitamin  in the body people who have pernicious anemia may need lifelong treatment
                
the goals of treating pernicious anemia include
                
preventing or treating the anemia and its signs and symptoms
                
preventing or managing complications such as heart and nerve damage
                
treating the cause of the pernicious anemia if a cause can be found
                
specific types of treatment
                
pernicious anemia usually is easy to treat with vitamin  shots or pills
                
if you have severe pernicious anemia your doctor may recommend shots first shots usually are given in a muscle every day or every week until the level of vitamin  in your blood increases after your vitamin  blood level returns to normal you may get a shot only once a month
                
for less severe pernicious anemia your doctor may recommend large doses of vitamin  pills a vitamin  nose gel and spray also are available these products may be useful for people who have trouble swallowing pills such as older people who have had strokes
                
your signs and symptoms may begin to improve within a few days after you start treatment your doctor may advise you to limit your physical activity until your condition improves
                
if your pernicious anemia is caused by something other than a lack of intrinsic factor you may get treatment for the cause if a cause can be found for example your doctor may prescribe medicines to treat a condition that prevents your body from absorbing vitamin 
                
if medicines are the cause of your pernicious anemia your doctor may change the type or dose of medicine you take infants of strict vegetarian mothers may be given vitamin  supplements from birth"
exams and tests,how to diagnose childhood ependymoma ,"tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect find childhood ependymoma the following tests and procedures may be used            physical exam and history  an exam of the body to check general signs of health including checking for signs of disease such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken       neurological exam  a series of questions and tests to check the brain spinal cord and nerve function the exam checks a persons mental status coordination and ability to walk normally and how well the muscles senses and reflexes work this may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam       mri magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium  a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord a substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream the gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri       lumbar puncture  a procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid csf from the spinal column this is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the csf around the spinal cord and removing a sample of fluid the sample of csf is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells the sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose a higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor this procedure is also called an lp or spinal tap
                    childhood ependymoma is diagnosed and removed in surgery if the diagnostic tests show there may be a brain tumor a biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of the brain tissue a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells if cancer cells are found the doctor will remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery     the following test may be done on the tissue that was removed            immunohistochemistry  a test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue the antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope this type of test may be used to tell the difference between brain stem glioma and other brain tumors         an mri is often done after the tumor is removed to find out whether any tumor remains"
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to proteus syndrome ,proteus syndrome results from a mutation in the  gene this genetic change is not inherited from a parent it arises randomly in one cell during the early stages of development before birth as cells continue to grow and divide some cells will have the mutation and other cells will not this mixture of cells with and without a genetic mutation is known as mosaicism  the  gene helps regulate cell growth and division proliferation and cell death a mutation in this gene disrupts a cells ability to regulate its own growth allowing it to grow and divide abnormally increased cell proliferation in various tissues and organs leads to the abnormal growth characteristic of proteus syndrome studies suggest that an  gene mutation is more common in groups of cells that experience overgrowth than in the parts of the body that grow normally  in some published case reports mutations in a gene called pten have been associated with proteus syndrome however many researchers now believe that individuals with pten gene mutations and asymmetric overgrowth do not meet the strict guidelines for a diagnosis of proteus syndrome instead these individuals actually have condition that is considered part of a larger group of disorders called pten hamartoma tumor syndrome one name that has been proposed for the condition is segmental overgrowth lipomatosis arteriovenous malformations and epidermal nevus solamen syndrome another is type  segmental cowden syndrome however some scientific articles still refer to ptenrelated proteus syndrome

other symptoms include
                
daytime sleepiness
                
morning headaches
                
memory learning or concentration problems
                
feeling irritable or depressed or having mood swings or personality changes
                
you also may have rapid shallow breathing during a physical exam your doctor might hear abnormal heart sounds while listening to your heart with a stethoscope he or she also might notice that the opening to your throat is small and your neck is larger than normal
                
complications of obesity hypoventilation syndrome
                
when left untreated ohs can cause serious problems such as
                
leg edema which is swelling in the legs caused by fluid in the bodys tissues
                
pulmonary hypertension which is increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries these arteries carry blood from your heart to your lungs to pick up oxygen

information,what is are pulmonary hypertension ,"pulmonary hypertension pullmunary hipertenshun or ph is increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries these arteries carry blood from your heart to your lungs to pick up oxygen
                
ph causes symptoms such as shortness of breath during routine activity for example climbing two flights of stairs tiredness chest pain and a racing heartbeat as the condition worsens its symptoms may limit all physical activity
                
overview
                
to understand ph it helps to understand how your heart and lungs work your heart has two sides separated by an inner wall called the septum
                
each side of your heart has an upper and lower chamber the lower right chamber of your heart the right ventricle ventrihkul pumps blood to your pulmonary arteries the blood then travels to your lungs where it picks up oxygen
                
the upper left chamber of your heart the left atrium aytreeum receives the oxygenrich blood from your lungs the blood is then pumped into the lower left chamber of your heart the left ventricle from the left ventricle the blood is pumped to the rest of your body through an artery called the aorta
                
for more information about the heart and lungs go to the diseases and conditions index how the heart works and how the lungs work articles
                
ph begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause ph for example the condition may develop if
                
the walls of the arteries tighten
                
the walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells
                
blood clots form in the arteries
                
these changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs as a result the pressure in your arteries rises also because your heart is working harder than normal your right ventricle becomes strained and weak
                
your heart may become so weak that it cant pump enough blood to your lungs this causes heart failure heart failure is the most common cause of death in people who have ph
                
ph is divided into five groups based on its causes in all groups the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than  mmhg at rest or  mmhg during physical activity the pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is  mmhg at rest the mmhg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure
                
other diseases or conditions such as heart and lung diseases or blood clots usually cause ph some people inherit the condition that is their parents pass the genes for ph on to them in some cases the cause isnt known
                
outlook
                
ph has no cure however research for new treatments is ongoing the earlier ph is treated the easier it is to control
                
treatments include medicines procedures and other therapies these treatments can relieve ph symptoms and slow the progress of the disease lifestyle changes also can help control symptoms"

symptoms,what are the symptoms of amniotic band syndrome ,what are the signs and symptoms of amniotic band syndrome the symptoms of amniotic band syndrome depend on the severity and location of the constrictions the mildest constrictions affect only the superficial skin and may not require treatment deeper constrictions may block lymphatic vessels impair blood flow and require immediate surgical care when the bands affect the limbs the lower part of the limbs are most often involved especially the middle long and index fingers of the hand when the feet are involved the bands most commonly affect the big toe pressure from the bands may result in additional abnormalities such as underdevelopment of a limb bone abnormalities amputations leglength discrepancy and club feet constriction bands across the head and face may lead to facial clefts severe clefts affecting vital organs are often lifethreatening the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for amniotic band syndrome if the information is available the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms signs and symptoms approximate number of patients when available amniotic constriction ring  finger syndactyly  split hand  talipes  aplasiahypoplasia of the lungs  aplasiahypoplasia of the radius  lymphedema  oligohydramnios  scoliosis  abnormal lung lobation  abnormality of the rib cage  bladder exstrophy  cleft eyelid  cleft palate  cleft upper lip  ectopia cordis  encephalocele  facial cleft  gastroschisis  hand polydactyly  omphalocele  sporadic  syndactyly  talipes equinovarus  the human phenotype ontology hpo has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition much of this information comes from orphanet a european rare disease database the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature the frequency may also be listed as a fraction the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study for example a frequency of  means that in a study of  people all patients were found to have that symptom because these frequencies are based on a specific study the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined sometimes no information on frequency is available in these cases the sign or symptom may be rare or common
information,what is are alopecia areata ,alopecia areata aa is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the hair follicles in most cases hair falls out in small round patches on the scalp although uncommon hair loss can be more extensive in some people and affect other parts of the body this condition can progress to complete loss of scalp hair alopecia totalis or total loss of all body hair alopecia universalis although the exact cause of aa is unknown roughly  of affected people have a family member with alopecia suggesting that genetic factors may contribute to the development of the condition there is no cure or approved therapy for aa however some people find that medications approved for other purposes can help regrow hair
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to keratitisichthyosisdeafness syndrome ,kid syndrome is caused by mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta  more commonly known as connexin  connexin  is a member of the connexin protein family connexin proteins form channels called gap junctions that permit the transport of nutrients charged atoms ions and signaling molecules between neighboring cells that are in contact with each other gap junctions made with connexin  transport potassium ions and certain small molecules  connexin  is found in cells throughout the body including the inner ear and the skin in the inner ear channels made from connexin  are found in a snailshaped structure called the cochlea these channels may help to maintain the proper level of potassium ions required for the conversion of sound waves to electrical nerve impulses this conversion is essential for normal hearing in addition connexin  may be involved in the maturation of certain cells in the cochlea connexin  also plays a role in the growth and maturation of the outermost layer of skin the epidermis  the  gene mutations that cause kid syndrome change single protein building blocks amino acids in connexin  the mutations are thought to result in channels that constantly leak ions which impairs the health of the cells and increases cell death death of cells in the skin and the inner ear may underlie the ichthyosis and deafness that occur in kid syndrome it is unclear how  gene mutations affect the eye  because at least one of the  gene mutations identified in people with kid syndrome also occurs in hystrixlike ichthyosis with deafness hid a disorder with similar features but without keratitis many researchers categorize kid syndrome and hid as a single disorder which they call kidhid it is not known why some people with this mutation have eye problems while others do not

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to ataxia with oculomotor apraxia ,mutations in the aptx and setx genes cause ataxia with oculomotor apraxia types  and  respectively these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in dna repair  mutations in the aptx or setx gene decrease the amount of functional protein that is available to repair damaged dna which leads to the accumulation of breaks in dna these breaks can be caused by natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures and also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material in preparation for cell division dna damage that is not repaired causes the cell to be unstable and can lead to cell death it is thought that nerve cells in the brain are particularly affected by cell death because these cells do not copy replicate themselves to replace cells that have been lost the part of the brain involved in coordinating movements the cerebellum is especially affected it is thought that the loss of brain cells in the cerebellum causes the movement problems characteristic of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia  mutations in other genes are responsible for the rare types of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia
symptoms,what are the symptoms of hashimotos encephalitis ,what are the signs and symptoms of hashimotos encephalitis the symptoms of hashimotos encephalitis can vary among affected people they most often include sudden or subacute onset of confusion with alteration of consciousness some affected people have multiple recurrent episodes of neurological deficits with cognitive dysfunction others experience a more progressive course characterized by slowly progressive cognitive impairment with dementia confusion hallucinations or sleepiness in some cases rapid deterioration to coma can occur in addition to confusion and mental status changes symptoms may include seizures and myoclonus muscle jerking or tremor psychosis including visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions has also been reported

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification ,mutations in the  gene cause nearly half of all cases of fibgc a small percentage of cases are caused by mutations in the pdgfrb gene other cases of fibgc appear to be associated with changes in chromosomes    and  although specific genes have yet to be identified these findings suggest that multiple genes are involved in this condition  the  gene provides instructions for making a protein called sodiumdependent phosphate transporter   this protein plays a major role in regulating phosphate levels within the body phosphate homeostasis by transporting phosphate across cell membranes the  gene mutations that cause fibgc lead to the production of a  protein that cannot effectively transport phosphate into cells as a result phosphate levels in the bloodstream rise in the brain the excess phosphate combines with calcium and forms deposits  the pdgfrb gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in turning on activating signaling pathways that control many cell processes it is unclear how pdgfrb gene mutations cause fibgc mutations may alter signaling within cells that line blood vessels in the brain causing them to take in excess calcium and leading to calcification of the lining of these blood vessels alternatively changes in the pdgfrb protein could alter phosphate transport signaling pathways causing an increase in phosphate levels and the formation of calcium deposits  researchers suggest that calcium deposits lead to the characteristic features of fibgc by interrupting signaling pathways in various parts of the brain calcium deposits may disrupt the pathways that connect the basal ganglia to other areas of the brain particularly the frontal lobes these areas at the front of the brain are involved in reasoning planning judgment and problemsolving the regions of the brain that regulate social behavior mood and motivation may also be affected  research has shown that people with significant calcification tend to have more signs and symptoms of fibgc than people with little or no calcification however this association does not apply to all people with fibgc
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia ,lch can be caused by mutations in the reln or  gene the reln gene provides instructions for making a protein called reelin in the developing brain reelin turns on activates a signaling pathway that triggers nerve cells neurons to migrate to their proper locations the protein produced from the  gene is also involved in neuronal migration as a component of cell structures called microtubules microtubules are rigid hollow fibers that make up the cells structural framework the cytoskeleton microtubules form scaffolding within the cell that elongates in a specific direction altering the cytoskeleton and moving neurons  mutations in either the reln or  gene impair the normal migration of neurons during fetal development as a result neurons are disorganized the normal folds and grooves of the brain do not form and brain structures do not develop properly this impairment of brain development leads to the neurological problems characteristic of lch
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to multiple pterygium syndrome ,mutations in the chrng gene cause most cases of multiple pterygium syndrome escobar type and a smaller percentage of cases of lethal multiple pterygium syndrome the chrng gene provides instructions for making the gamma  protein component subunit of the acetylcholine receptor achr protein the achr protein is found in the membrane of skeletal muscle cells and is critical for signaling between nerve and muscle cells signaling between these cells is necessary for movement the achr protein consists of five subunits the  subunit is found only in the fetal achr protein at about the thirtythird week of pregnancy the  subunit is replaced by another subunit to form adult achr protein the replacement of fetal achr by adult achr is the reason most people with multiple pterygium syndrome escobar type do not have problems with muscle movement after birth  chrng gene mutations result in an impaired or missing  subunit the severity of the chrng gene mutation influences the severity of the condition typically mutations that prevent the production of any  subunit will result in the lethal type while mutations that allow the production of some  subunit will lead to the escobar type without a functional  subunit the fetal achr protein cannot be assembled or properly placed in the muscle cell membrane as a result the fetal achr protein cannot function and the communication between nerve cells and muscle cells in the developing fetus is impaired a lack of signaling between nerve and muscle cells leads to akinesia and pterygium before birth and may result in many of the other signs and symptoms of multiple pterygium syndrome  mutations in other genes most providing instructions for other achr protein subunits have been found to cause multiple pterygium syndrome changes in these genes can cause both the lethal and escobar types of this condition although they account for only a small number of cases some people with multiple pterygium syndrome do not have an identified mutation in any of the known genes associated with this condition the cause of the disease in these individuals is unknown

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic nets
                    different types of treatments are available for patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors nets some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    six types of standard treatment are used
                    surgery     an operation may be done to remove the tumor one of the following types of surgery may be used              enucleation surgery to remove the tumor only this may be done when cancer occurs in one place in the pancreas       pancreatoduodenectomy a surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas the gallbladder nearby lymph nodes and part of the stomach small intestine and bile duct are removed enough of the pancreas is left to make digestive juices and insulin the organs removed during this procedure depend on the patients condition this is also called the whipple procedure       distal pancreatectomy surgery to remove the body and tail of the pancreas the spleen may also be removed      total gastrectomy surgery to remove the whole stomach       parietal cell vagotomy surgery to cut the nerve that causes stomach cells to make acid       liver resection surgery to remove part or all of the liver       radiofrequency ablation the use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed in other cases the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen this is done in the hospital with general anesthesia        cryosurgical ablation a procedure in which tissue is frozen to destroy abnormal cells this is usually done with a special instrument that contains liquid nitrogen or liquid carbon dioxide the instrument may be used during surgery or laparoscopy or inserted through the skin this procedure is also called cryoablation               chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated       hormone therapy     hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow if tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach receptors drugs surgery or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working       hepatic arterial occlusion or chemoembolization     hepatic arterial occlusion uses drugs small particles or other agents to block or reduce the flow of blood to the liver through the hepatic artery the major blood vessel that carries blood to the liver this is done to kill cancer cells growing in the liver the tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow the liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein which carries blood from the stomach and intestine    chemotherapy delivered during hepatic arterial occlusion is called chemoembolization the anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter thin tube the drug is mixed with the substance that blocks the artery and cuts off blood flow to the tumor most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body    the blockage may be temporary or permanent depending on the substance used to block the artery        targeted therapy     targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells certain types of targeted therapies are being studied in the treatment of pancreatic nets       supportive care     supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment supportive care for pancreatic nets may include treatment for the following             stomach ulcers may be treated with drug therapy such as                    proton pump inhibitor drugs such as omeprazole lansoprazole or pantoprazole        histamine blocking drugs such as cimetidine ranitidine or famotidine        somatostatintype drugs such as octreotide                  diarrhea may be treated with                     intravenous iv fluids with electrolytes such as potassium or chloride         somatostatintype drugs such as octreotide                 low blood sugar may be treated by having small frequent meals or with drug therapy to maintain a normal blood sugar level       high blood sugar may be treated with drugs taken by mouth or insulin by injection
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials

                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

exams and tests,how to diagnose von willebrand disease ,"early diagnosis of von willebrand disease vwd is important to make sure that youre treated and can live a normal active life
                
sometimes vwd is hard to diagnose people who have type  or type  vwd may not have major bleeding problems thus they may not be diagnosed unless they have heavy bleeding after surgery or some other trauma
                
on the other hand type  vwd can cause major bleeding problems during infancy and childhood so children who have type  vwd usually are diagnosed during their first year of life
                
to find out whether you have vwd your doctor will review your medical history and the results from a physical exam and tests
                
medical history
                
your doctor will likely ask questions about your medical history and your familys medical history he or she may ask about
                
any bleeding from a small wound that lasted more than  minutes or started up again within the first  days following the injury
                
any prolonged heavy or repeated bleeding that required medical care after surgery or dental extractions
                
any bruising with little or no apparent trauma especially if you could feel a lump under the bruise
                
any nosebleeds that occurred for no known reason and lasted more than  minutes despite pressure on the nose or any nosebleeds that needed medical attention
                
any blood in your stools for no known reason
                
any heavy menstrual bleeding for women this bleeding usually involves clots or lasts longer than  to  days
                
any history of muscle or joint bleeding
                
any medicines youve taken that might cause bleeding or increase the risk of bleeding examples include aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids clopidogrel warfarin or heparin
                
any history of liver or kidney disease blood or bone marrow disease or high or low blood platelet counts
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will do a physical exam to look for unusual bruising or other signs of recent bleeding he or she also will look for signs of liver disease or anemia a low red blood cell count
                
diagnostic tests
                
no single test can diagnose vwd your doctor may recommend one or more blood tests to diagnose the disorder these tests may include
                
von willebrand factor antigen this test measures the amount of von willebrand factor in your blood
                
von willebrand factor ristocetin ristoseetin cofactor activity this test shows how well your von willebrand factor works
                
factor viii clotting activity this test checks the clotting activity of factor viii some people who have vwd have low levels of factor viii activity while others have normal levels
                
von willebrand factor multimers this test is done if one or more of the first three tests are abnormal it shows the structure of your von willebrand factor the test helps your doctor diagnose what type of vwd you have
                
platelet function test this test measures how well your platelets are working
                
you may have these tests more than once to confirm a diagnosis your doctor also may refer you to a hematologist to confirm the diagnosis and for followup care a hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood disorders"
treatment,what are the treatments for childhood nephrotic syndrome ,"health care providers will decide how to treat childhood nephrotic syndrome based on the type
                
 primary childhood nephrotic syndrome medications   secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome treat the underlying illness or disease   congenital nephrotic syndrome medications surgery to remove one or both kidneys and transplantation
                
primary childhood nephrotic syndrome
                
health care providers treat idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome with several types of medications that control the immune system remove extra fluid and lower blood pressure
                
 control the immune system corticosteroids are a group of medications that reduce the activity of the immune system decrease the amount of albumin lost in the urine and decrease swelling health care providers commonly use prednisone or a related corticosteroid to treat idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome about  percent of children achieve remission with daily corticosteroids for  weeks and then a slightly smaller dose every other day for   remission is a period when the child is symptomfree  many children relapse after initial therapy and health care providers treat them with a shorter course of corticosteroids until the disease goes into remission again children may have multiple relapses however they most often recover without longterm kidney damage  when a child has frequent relapses or does not respond to treatment a health care provider may prescribe other medications that reduce the activity of the immune system these medications prevent the body from making antibodies that can damage kidney tissues they include       cyclophosphamide     mycophenolate cellcept myfortic     cyclosporine     tacrolimus hecoria prograf   a health care provider may use these other immune system medications with corticosteroids or in place of corticosteroids   remove extra fluid a health care provider may prescribe a diuretic a medication that helps the kidneys remove extra fluid from the blood removing the extra fluid can often help to lower blood pressure   lower blood pressure some children with childhood nephrotic syndrome develop high blood pressure and may need to take additional medications to lower their blood pressure two types of blood pressurelowering medications angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have the additional benefit of slowing the progression of kidney disease many children with nephrotic syndrome require two or more medications to control their blood pressure
                
secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome
                
health care providers treat secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome by treating the underlying cause of the primary illness for example a health care provider may treat children by
                
 prescribing antibiotics for an infection   adjusting medications to treat lupus hiv or diabetes   changing or stopping medications that are known to cause secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome
                
while treating the underlying cause the health care provider will also treat the child to improve or restore kidney function with the same medications used to treat primary childhood nephrotic syndrome
                
caretakers should make sure that children take all prescribed medications and follow the treatment plan recommended by their health care provider
                
more information about specific treatments for secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome is provided in the niddk health topic glomerular diseases
                
congenital nephrotic syndrome
                
researchers have found that medications are not effective in treating congenital nephrotic syndrome and that most children will need a kidney transplant by the time they are  or  years old a kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney from someone who has just died or a living donor most often a family member into a persons body to take over the job of the failing kidney to keep the child healthy until the transplant the health care provider may recommend the following
                
 albumin injections to make up for the albumin lost in urine   diuretics to help remove extra fluid that causes swelling   antibiotics to treat the first signs of infection   growth hormones to promote growth and help bones mature   removal of one or both kidneys to decrease the loss of albumin in the urine   dialysis to artificially filter wastes from the blood if the kidneys fail

treatment,what are the treatments for fanconi anemia ,"doctors decide how to treat fanconi anemia fa based on a persons age and how well the persons bone marrow is making new blood cells
                
goals of treatment
                
longterm treatments for fa can
                
cure the anemia damaged bone marrow cells are replaced with healthy ones that can make enough of all three types of blood cells on their own
                
or
                
treat the symptoms without curing the cause this is done using medicines and other substances that can help your body make more blood cells for a limited time
                
screening and shortterm treatment
                
even if you or your child has fa your bone marrow might still be able to make enough new blood cells if so your doctor might suggest frequent blood count checks so he or she can watch your condition
                
your doctor will probably want you to have bone marrow tests once a year he or she also will screen you for any signs of cancer or tumors
                
if your blood counts begin to drop sharply and stay low your bone marrow might be failing your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to help your body fight infections in the short term he or she also may want to give you blood transfusions to increase your blood cell counts to normal levels
                
however longterm use of blood transfusions can reduce the chance that other treatments will work
                
longterm treatment
                
the four main types of longterm treatment for fa are
                
blood and marrow stem cell transplant
                
androgen therapy
                
synthetic growth factors
                
gene therapy
                
blood and marrow stem cell transplant
                
a blood and marrow stem cell transplant is the current standard treatment for patients who have fa thats causing major bone marrow failure healthy stem cells from another person called a donor are used to replace the faulty cells in your bone marrow
                
if youre going to receive stem cells from another person your doctor will want to find a donor whose stem cells match yours as closely as possible
                
stem cell transplants are most successful in younger people who
                
have few or no serious health problems
                
receive stem cells from a brother or sister who is a good donor match 
                
have had few or no previous blood transfusions
                
during the transplant youll get donated stem cells in a procedure thats like a blood transfusion once the new stem cells are in your body they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells
                
a successful stem cell transplant will allow your body to make enough of all three types of blood cells
                
even if youve had a stem cell transplant to treat fa youre still at risk for some types of blood cancer and cancerous solid tumors your doctor will check your health regularly after the procedure
                
for more information about stem cell transplantsincluding finding a donor having the procedure and learning about the risksgo to the health topics blood and marrow stem cell transplant article
                
androgen therapy
                
before improvements made stem cell transplants more effective androgen therapy was the standard treatment for people who had fa androgens are manmade male hormones that can help your body make more blood cells for long periods
                
androgens increase your red blood cell and platelet counts they dont work as well at raising your white blood cell count
                
unlike a stem cell transplant androgens dont allow your bone marrow to make enough of all three types of blood cells on its own you may need ongoing treatment with androgens to control the effects of fa
                
also over time androgens lose their ability to help your body make more blood cells which means youll need other treatments
                
androgen therapy can have serious side effects such as liver disease this treatment also cant prevent you from developing leukemia a type of blood cancer
                
synthetic growth factors
                
your doctor may choose to treat your fa with growth factors these are substances found in your body but they also can be manmade
                
growth factors help your body make more red and white blood cells growth factors that help your body make more platelets still are being studied
                
more research is needed on growth factor treatment for fa early results suggest that growth factors may have fewer and less serious side effects than androgens
                
gene therapy
                
researchers are looking for ways to replace faulty fa genes with normal healthy genes they hope these genes will make proteins that can repair and protect your bone marrow cells early results of this therapy hold promise but more research is needed
                
surgery
                
fa can cause birth defects that affect the arms thumbs hips legs and other parts of the body doctors may recommend surgery to repair some defects
                
for example your child might be born with a ventricular septal defecta hole or defect in the wall that separates the lower chambers of the heart his or her doctor may recommend surgery to close the hole so the heart can work properly
                
children who have fa also may need surgery to correct digestive system problems that can harm their nutrition growth and survival
                
one of the most common problems is an farelated birth defect in which the trachea windpipe which carries air to the lungs is connected to the esophagus which carries food to the stomach
                
this can cause serious breathing swallowing and eating problems and can lead to lung infections surgery is needed to separate the two organs and allow normal eating and breathing"

information,what is are malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy ,malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy mmpsi is a severe form of epilepsy that begins very early in life recurrent seizures begin before the age of  months but commonly start within a few weeks of birth the seizures do not respond well to treatment although affected individuals may develop normally at first progression stalls and skills decline when seizures begin as a result affected individuals have profound developmental delay  the seizures in mmpsi are described as partial or focal because the seizure activity occurs in regions of the brain rather than affecting the entire brain seizure activity can appear in multiple locations in the brain or move migrate from one region to another during an episode depending on the region affected seizures can involve sudden redness and warmth flushing of the face drooling short pauses in breathing apnea movement of the head or eyes to one side twitches in the eyelids or tongue chewing motions or jerking of an arm leg or both on one side of the body if seizure activity spreads to affect the entire brain it causes a loss of consciousness muscle stiffening and rhythmic jerking tonicclonic seizure episodes that begin as partial seizures and spread throughout the brain are known as secondarily generalized seizures  initially the seizures associated with mmpsi are relatively infrequent occurring every few weeks within a few months of the seizures starting though the frequency increases affected individuals can have clusters of five to  seizures several times a day each seizure typically lasts seconds to a couple of minutes but they can be prolonged classified as status epilepticus in some cases the seizure activity may be almost continuous for several days after a year or more of persistent seizures the episodes become less frequent  seizures can affect growth of the brain and lead to a small head size microcephaly the problems with brain development can also cause profound developmental delay and intellectual impairment affected babies often lose the mental and motor skills they developed after birth such as the ability to make eye contact and control their head movement many have weak muscle tone hypotonia and become floppy if seizures can be controlled for a short period development may improve some affected children learn to reach for objects or walk however most children with this condition do not develop language skills  because of the serious health problems caused by mmpsi many affected individuals do not survive past infancy or early childhood
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to congenital stromal corneal dystrophy ,congenital stromal corneal dystrophy is caused by mutations in the dcn gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein called decorin which is involved in the organization of collagens collagens are proteins that strengthen and support connective tissues such as skin bone tendons and ligaments in the cornea wellorganized bundles of collagen make the cornea transparent decorin ensures that collagen fibrils in the cornea are uniformly sized and regularly spaced  mutations in the dcn gene lead to the production of a defective version of decorin this abnormal protein interferes with the organization of collagen fibrils in the cornea as poorly arranged collagen fibrils accumulate the cornea becomes cloudy these corneal changes lead to reduced visual acuity and related eye abnormalities

prevention,how to prevent parasites  schistosomiasis ,"prevention
    
no vaccine is available
    
the best way to prevent schistosomiasis is to take the following steps if you are visiting or live in an area where schistosomiasis is transmitted
    
      avoid swimming or wading in freshwater when you are in countries in which schistosomiasis occurs swimming in the ocean and in chlorinated swimming pools is safe
      drink safe water although schistosomiasis is not transmitted by swallowing contaminated water if your mouth or lips come in contact with water containing the parasites you could become infected because water coming directly from canals lakes rivers streams or springs may be contaminated with a variety of infectious organisms you should either bring your water to a rolling boil for  minute or filter water before drinking it bring your water to a rolling boil for at least  minute will kill any harmful parasites bacteria or viruses present iodine treatment alone will not guarantee that water is safe and free of all parasites
      water used for bathing should be brought to a rolling boil for  minute to kill any cercariae and then cooled before bathing to avoid scalding water held in a storage tank for at least    days should be safe for bathing
      vigorous towel drying after an accidental very brief water exposure may help to prevent the schistosoma parasite from penetrating the skin however do not rely on vigorous towel drying alone to prevent schistosomiasis
    
    
those who have had contact with potentially contaminated water overseas should see their health care provider after returning from travel to discuss testing
    
more on schistosomiasis in travelers
   
  
  
   control
   
in countries where schistosomiasis causes significant disease control efforts usually focus on
   
     reducing the number of infections in people andor
     eliminating the snails that are required to maintain the parasite’s life cycle
   
   
for all species that cause schistosomiasis improved sanitation could reduce or eliminate transmission of this disease in some areas with lower transmission levels elimination of schistosomiasis is considered a winnable battle by public health officials
   
control measures can include mass drug treatment of entire communities and targeted treatment of schoolage children some of the problems with control of schistosomiasis include
   
     chemicals used to eliminate snails in freshwater sources may harm other species of animals in the water and if treatment is not sustained the snails may return to those sites afterwards
     for certain species of the parasite such as s japonicum animals such as cows or water buffalo can also be infected runoff from pastures if the cows are infected can contaminate freshwater sources"

treatment,what are the treatments for osteoarthritis ,treatment goals manage pain improve function osteoarthritis treatment plans often include ways to manage pain and improve function such plans can include exercise rest and joint care pain relief weight control medicines surgery and nontraditional treatment approaches current treatments for osteoarthritis can relieve symptoms such as pain and disability but right now there are no treatments that can cure osteoarthritis exercise one of the best treatments exercise is one of the best treatments for osteoarthritis it can improve mood and outlook decrease pain increase flexibility and help you maintain a healthy weight the amount and form of exercise will depend on which joints are involved how stable the joints are whether or not the joint is swollen and whether a joint replacement has already been done ask your doctor or physical therapist what exercises are best for you the following types of exercise are part of a wellrounded arthritis treatment plan   strengthening exercises  these exercises strengthen muscles that support joints affected by arthritis they can be performed with weights or with exercise bands inexpensive devices that add resistance   aerobic activities  these are exercises such as brisk walking or lowimpact aerobics that get your heart pumping and can keep your lungs and circulatory system in shape

exercise and physical activity program for older adults weight control if you are overweight or obese you should try to lose weight weight loss can reduce stress on weightbearing joints limit further injury increase mobility and reduce the risk of associated health problems a dietitian can help you develop healthy eating habits a healthy diet and regular exercise help reduce weight rest and relief from stress on joints treatment plans include regularly scheduled rest you must learn to recognize the bodys signals and know when to stop or slow down this will prevent the pain caused by overexertion although pain can make it difficult to sleep getting proper sleep is important for managing arthritis pain if you have trouble sleeping you may find that relaxation techniques stress reduction and biofeedback can help timing medications to provide maximum pain relief through the night can also help if joint pain interferes with your ability to sleep or rest consult your doctor some people find relief from special footwear and insoles that can reduce pain and improve walking or from using canes to take pressure off painful joints they may use splints or braces to provide extra support for joints and or keep them in proper position during sleep or activity splints should be used only for limited periods of time because joints and muscles need to be exercised to prevent stiffness and weakness if you need a splint an occupational therapist or a doctor can help you get a properly fitted one nondrug pain relief and alternative therapies people with osteoarthritis may find many nondrug ways to relieve pain below are some examples  heat and cold heat or cold or a combination of the two can be useful for joint pain heat can be applied in a number of different ways  with warm towels hot packs or a warm bath or shower  to increase blood flow and ease pain and stiffness in some cases cold packs bags of ice or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel which reduce

factors when choosing medicines for their patients in particular they look at the type of pain the patient may be having and any possible side effects from the drugs for pain relief doctors usually start with acetaminophen because the side effects are minimal if acetaminophen does not relieve pain then nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen may be used some nsaids are available over the counter while more than a dozen others including a subclass called  inhibitors are available only with a prescription other medications including corticosteroids hyaluronic acid and topical creams are also used reduce the risks of nsaid use most medicines used to treat osteoarthritis have side effects so it is important for people to learn about the medicines they take for example people over age  and those with any history of ulcers or stomach bleeding should use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or nsaids with caution there are measures you can take to help reduce the risk of side effects associated with nsaids these include taking medications with food and avoiding stomach irritants such as alcohol tobacco and caffeine in some cases it may help to take another medication along with an nsaid to coat the stomach or block stomach acids although these measures may help they are not always completely effective for more tips on how older adults can avoid side effects see side effects  in the taking medicines topic surgery for many people surgery helps relieve the pain and disability of osteoarthritis surgery may be performed to achieve one or more of the following goals  removal of loose pieces of bone and cartilage from the joint if they are causing symptoms of buckling or locking arthroscopic debridement   repositioning of bones osteotomy   resurfacing smoothing out bones joint resurfacing removal of loose pieces of bone and cartilage from the joint if they are causing symptoms of buckling or locking arthroscopic debridement repositioning of bones osteotomy resurfacing smoothing out bones joint resurfacing joint replacement surgeons may replace affected joints with artificial joints called prostheses these joints can be made from metal alloys highdensity plastic and ceramic material some prostheses are joined to bone surfaces with special cements others have porous surfaces and rely on the growth of bone into that surface a process called biologic fixation to hold them in place artificial joints can last  to  years or longer surgeons choose the design and components of prostheses according to their patients weight sex age activity level and other medical conditions joint replacement advances in recent years have included the ability in some cases to replace only the damaged part of the knee joint leaving undamaged parts of the joint intact and the ability to perform hip replacement through much smaller incisions than previously possible for more on joint replacement see the hip replacement and knee replacement topics deciding on surgery the decision to use surgery depends on several factors including the patients age occupation level of disability pain intensity and the degree to which arthritis interferes with his or her lifestyle after surgery and rehabilitation the patient usually feels less pain and swelling and can move more easily
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ,mutations in the fas gene cause alps in approximately  percent of affected individuals the fas gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in cell signaling that results in the selfdestruction of cells apoptosis  when the immune system is turned on activated to fight an infection large numbers of lymphocytes are produced normally these lymphocytes undergo apoptosis when they are no longer required fas gene mutations result in an abnormal protein that interferes with apoptosis excess lymphocytes accumulate in the bodys tissues and organs and often begin attacking them leading to autoimmune disorders interference with apoptosis allows cells to multiply without control leading to the lymphomas and other cancers that occur in people with this disorder  alps may also be caused by mutations in additional genes some of which have not been identified

exams and tests,how to diagnose urinary retention ,"a health care provider diagnoses acute or chronic urinary retention with
                
 a physical exam   postvoid residual measurement
                
a health care provider may use the following medical tests to help determine the cause of urinary retention
                
 cystoscopy   computerized tomography ct scans   urodynamic tests   electromyography
                
physical exam
                
a health care provider may suspect urinary retention because of a patients symptoms and therefore perform a physical exam of the lower abdomen the health care provider may be able to feel a distended bladder by lightly tapping on the lower belly
                
postvoid residual measurement
                
this test measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination the remaining urine is called the postvoid residual a specially trained technician performs an ultrasound which uses harmless sound waves to create a picture of the bladder to measure the postvoid residual the technician performs the bladder ultrasound in a health care providers office a radiology center or a hospital and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images the patient does not need anesthesia
                
a health care provider may use a cathetera thin flexible tubeto measure postvoid residual the health care provider inserts the catheter through the urethra into the bladder a procedure called catheterization to drain and measure the amount of remaining urine a postvoid residual of  ml or more indicates the bladder does not empty completely a health care provider performs this test during an office visit the patient often receives local anesthesia
                
medical tests
                
cystoscopy cystoscopy is a procedure that requires a tubelike instrument called a cystoscope to look inside the urethra and bladder a health care provider performs cystoscopy during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital the patient will receive local anesthesia however in some cases the patient may receive sedation and regional or general anesthesia a health care provider may use cystoscopy to diagnose urethral stricture or look for a bladder stone blocking the opening of the urethra
                
more information is provided in the niddk health topic cystoscopy and ureteroscopy
                
ct scans ct scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images for a ct scan a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye called contrast medium ct scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnelshaped device where a technician takes the x rays an xray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital and a radiologist interprets the images the patient does not need anesthesia a health care provider may give infants and children a sedative to help them fall asleep for the test ct scans can show
                
 urinary tract stones   utis   tumors   traumatic injuries   abnormal fluidcontaining sacs called cysts
                
urodynamic tests urodynamic tests include a variety of procedures that look at how well the bladder and urethra store and release urine a health care provider may use one or more urodynamic tests to diagnose urinary retention the health care provider will perform these tests during an office visit for tests that use a catheter the patient often receives local anesthesia
                
 uroflowmetry uroflowmetry measures urine speed and volume special equipment automatically measures the amount of urine and the flow ratehow fast urine comes out uroflowmetry equipment includes a device for catching and measuring urine and a computer to record the data the equipment creates a graph that shows changes in flow rate from second to second so the health care provider can see the highest flow rate and how many seconds it takes to get there a weak bladder muscle or blocked urine flow will yield an abnormal test result   pressure flow study a pressure flow study measures the bladder pressure required to urinate and the flow rate a given pressure generates a health care provider places a catheter with a manometer into the bladder the manometer measures bladder pressure and flow rate as the bladder empties a pressure flow study helps diagnose bladder outlet obstruction   video urodynamics this test uses x rays or ultrasound to create realtime images of the bladder and urethra during the filling or emptying of the bladder for x rays a health care provider passes a catheter through the urethra into the bladder he or she fills the bladder with contrast medium which is visible on the video images video urodynamic images can show the size and shape of the urinary tract the flow of urine and causes of urinary retention such as bladder neck obstruction
                
more information is provided in the niddk health topic urodynamic testing
                
electromyography electromyography uses special sensors to measure the electrical activity of the muscles and nerves in and around the bladder and sphincters a specially trained technician places sensors on the skin near the urethra and rectum or on a urethral or rectal catheter the sensors record on a machine muscle and nerve activity the patterns of the nerve impulses show whether the messages sent to the bladder and sphincters coordinate correctly a technician performs electromyography in a health care providers office an outpatient center or a hospital the patient does not need anesthesia if the technician uses sensors placed on the skin the patient will receive local anesthesia if the technician uses sensors placed on a urethral or rectal catheter"

exams and tests,how to diagnose parasites  toxoplasmosis toxoplasma infection ,"the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is typically made by serologic testing a test that measures immunoglobulin g igg is used to determine if a person has been infected if it is necessary to try to estimate the time of infection which is of particular importance for pregnant women a test which measures immunoglobulin m igm is also used along with other tests such as an avidity test
    
diagnosis can be made by direct observation of the parasite in stained tissue sections cerebrospinal fluid csf or other biopsy material these techniques are used less frequently because of the difficulty of obtaining these specimens
    
parasites can also be isolated from blood or other body fluids for example csf but this process can be difficult and requires considerable time
    
molecular techniques that can detect the parasites dna in the amniotic fluid can be useful in cases of possible mothertochild congenital transmission
    
ocular disease is diagnosed based on the appearance of the lesions in the eye symptoms course of disease and often serologic testing"

symptoms,what are the symptoms of narcolepsy ,"the four major signs and symptoms of narcolepsy are extreme daytime sleepiness cataplexy muscle weakness while awake and hallucinations and sleep paralysis during sleep
                
if you have narcolepsy you may have one or more of these symptoms they can range from mild to severe less than onethird of people who have narcolepsy have all four symptoms
                
extreme daytime sleepiness
                
all people who have narcolepsy have extreme daytime sleepiness this often is the most obvious symptom of the disorder
                
during the day you may have few or many periods of sleepiness each period usually lasts  or less strong emotionssuch as anger fear laughter or excitementcan trigger this sleepiness
                
people who have daytime sleepiness often complain of
                
mental cloudiness or fog
                
memory problems or problems focusing
                
lack of energy or extreme exhaustion
                
depression
                
some people who have narcolepsy have episodes in which they fall asleep suddenly this is more likely to happen when theyre not activefor example while reading watching tv or sitting in a meeting
                
however sleep episodes also may occur in the middle of talking eating or another activity cataplexy also may occur at the same time
                
cataplexy
                
this condition causes loss of muscle tone while youre awake muscle weakness affects part or all of your body
                
cataplexy may make your head nod or make it hard for you to speak muscle weakness also may make your knees weak or cause you to drop things youre holding some people lose all muscle control and fall
                
strong emotionssuch as anger surprise fear or laughteroften trigger cataplexy it usually lasts a few seconds or minutes during this time youre usually awake
                
cataplexy may occur weeks to years after you first start to have extreme daytime sleepiness
                
hallucinations
                
if you have narcolepsy you may have vivid dreams while falling asleep waking up or dozing these dreams can feel very real you may feel like you can see hear smell and taste things
                
sleep paralysis
                
this condition prevents you from moving or speaking while falling asleep or waking up however youre fully conscious aware during this time sleep paralysis usually lasts just a few seconds or minutes but it can be scary
                
other symptoms
                
most people who have narcolepsy dont sleep well at night they may have trouble falling and staying asleep vivid scary dreams may disturb sleep not sleeping well at night worsens daytime sleepiness
                
rarely people who fall asleep in the middle of an activity such as eating may continue that activity for a few seconds or minutes this is called automatic behavior
                
during automatic behavior youre not aware of your actions so you dont do them well for example if youre writing before falling asleep you may scribble rather than form words if youre driving you may get lost or have an accident most people who have this symptom dont remember what happened while it was going on
                
children who have narcolepsy often have trouble studying focusing and remembering things also they may seem hyperactive some children who have narcolepsy speed up their activities rather than slow them down
                
children who have narcolepsy may have severe sleepiness they may fall asleep while talking or eating or during sporting events and social activities"

susceptibility,who is at risk for parasites  loiasis ,"loa loa parasites are found in west and central africa ten countries have areas where there are high rates of infection ie where more than  of the people who live in that area report that they have had eye worm in the past an estimated  million people live in these areas of high rates of infection another  live in areas where – of people report that they have had eye worm in the past
    
more on where loa loa is prevelant 
    
the people most at risk for loiasis are those who live in the certain rain forests in west and central africa the deerflies that pass the parasite to humans usually bite during the day and are more common during the rainy season they are attracted by the movement of people and by smoke from wood fires rubber plantations are areas where more deerflies may be found the flies do not typically enter homes but they might be attracted to homes that are well lit
    
travelers are more likely to become infected if they are in areas where they are bitten by deerflies for many months though occasionally they get infected even if they are in an affected area for less than  days
    
your risk of infection depends on the number of bites received the number of infected deerflies in the area you visit and the length of your stay in the area"

information,what is are hypersensitivity pneumonitis ,"hypersensitivity pneumonitis noomonitis or hp is a disease in which the lungs become inflamed from breathing in foreign substances such as molds dusts and chemicals these substances also are known as antigens antihjens
                
people are exposed to antigens at home while at work and in other settings however most people who breathe in these substances dont develop hp
                
overview
                
to understand hp it helps to understand how the lungs work when you breathe air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe the air then travels to your lungs air sacs these sacs are called alveoli alveeuhleye
                
small blood vessels called capillaries run through the walls of the air sacs when air reaches the air sacs the oxygen in the air passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries the capillaries connect to a network of arteries and veins that move blood through your body
                
in hp the air sacs become inflamed and may fill with fluid this makes it harder for oxygen to pass through the air sacs and into the bloodstream
                
the two main types of hp are acute shortterm and chronic ongoing both types can develop as a result of repeatedly breathing in an antigen
                
over time your lungs can become sensitive to that antigen if this happens theyll become inflamed which can lead to symptoms and may even cause longterm lung damage
                
with acute hp symptoms usually occur within  hours of exposure to an antigen youre sensitive to acute hp can cause chills body aches coughing and chest tightness after hours or days of no contact with the antigen symptoms usually go away
                
if acute hp isnt found and treated early chronic hp may develop symptoms of chronic hp occur slowly over months chronic hp can cause a worsening cough shortness of breath with physical activity fatigue tiredness and weight loss severe hp may cause clubbing a widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes
                
with chronic hp symptoms may continue andor worsen even after avoiding the antigen sometimes chronic hp can cause longterm lung damage such as pulmonary fibrosis pullmunary fibrosis this is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time
                
outlook
                
avoiding or reducing your contact with antigens can help prevent and treat hp for example cleaning heating and ventilation filters can help reduce your contact with mold wetting compost prior to handling it can reduce contact with harmful dust
                
if hp is caught early avoiding the antigen that caused it may be the only treatment you need if you have chronic hp your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce lung inflammation
                
researchers continue to study why some people develop hp after being exposed to antigens while others dont theyre also looking for better ways to quickly pinpoint which antigens are causing hp in people who are believed to have the disease"
complications,what are the complications of primary biliary cirrhosis ,"most complications of primary biliary cirrhosis are related to cirrhosis and start after primary biliary cirrhosis progresses to cirrhosis in some cases portal hypertension and esophageal varices may develop before cirrhosis
                
portal hypertension the portal vein carries blood from the stomach intestines spleen gallbladder and pancreas to the liver in cirrhosis scar tissue partially blocks the normal flow of blood which increases the pressure in the portal vein this condition is called portal hypertension portal hypertension is a common complication of cirrhosis this condition may lead to other complications such as
                
 edemaswelling due to a buildup of fluidin the feet ankles or legs and ascitesa buildup of fluid in the abdomen   enlarged blood vessels called varices in the esophagus stomach or both   an enlarged spleen called splenomegaly   mental confusion due to a buildup of toxins that are ordinarily removed by the liver a condition called hepatic encephalopathy
                
edema and ascites liver failure causes fluid buildup that results in edema and ascites ascites can lead to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis a serious infection that requires immediate medical attention
                
varices portal hypertension may cause enlarged blood vessels in the esophagus stomach or both these enlarged blood vessels called esophageal or gastric varices cause the vessel walls to become thin and blood pressure to increase making the blood vessels more likely to burst if they burst serious bleeding can occur in the esophagus or upper stomach requiring immediate medical attention
                
splenomegaly portal hypertension may cause the spleen to enlarge and retain white blood cells and platelets reducing the numbers of these cells and platelets in the blood a low platelet count may be the first evidence that a person has developed cirrhosis
                
hepatic encephalopathy a failing liver cannot remove toxins from the blood so they eventually accumulate in the brain the buildup of toxins in the brain is called hepatic encephalopathy this condition can decrease mental function and cause stupor and even coma stupor is an unconscious sleeplike state from which a person can only be aroused briefly by a strong stimulus such as a sharp pain coma is an unconscious sleeplike state from which a person cannot be aroused signs of decreased mental function include
                
 confusion   personality changes   memory loss   trouble concentrating   a change in sleep habits
                
metabolic bone diseases some people with cirrhosis develop a metabolic bone disease which is a disorder of bone strength usually caused by abnormalities of vitamin d bone mass bone structure or minerals such as calcium and phosphorous osteopenia is a condition in which the bones become less dense making them weaker when bone loss becomes more severe the condition is referred to as osteoporosis people with these conditions are more likely to develop bone fractures
                
gallstones and bile duct stones if cirrhosis prevents bile from flowing freely to and from the gallbladder the bile hardens into gallstones symptoms of gallstones include abdominal pain and recurrent bacterial cholangitisirritated or infected bile ducts stones may also form in and block the bile ducts causing pain jaundice and bacterial cholangitis
                
steatorrhea steatorrhea is a condition in which the body cannot absorb fat causing a buildup of fat in the stool and loose greasy and foulsmelling bowel movements steatorrhea may be caused by impairment of bile delivery to the small intestine or by the pancreas not producing enough digestive enzymes
                
liver cancer liver cancer is common in people with cirrhosis liver cancer has a high mortality rate current treatments are limited and only fully successful if a health care provider detects the cancer early before the tumor is too large for this reason health care providers should check people with cirrhosis for signs of liver cancer every  to  months health care providers use blood tests ultrasound or both to check for signs of liver cancer"

symptoms,what are the symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and addisons disease ,"adrenal insufficiency
                
the most common symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are
                
 chronic or long lasting fatigue    muscle weakness    loss of appetite    weight loss    abdominal pain
                
other symptoms of adrenal insufficiency can include
                
 nausea    vomiting    diarrhea    low blood pressure that drops further when a person stands up causing dizziness or fainting    irritability and depression    craving salty foods    hypoglycemia or low blood sugar    headache    sweating    irregular or absent menstrual periods    in women loss of interest in sex
                
hyperpigmentation or darkening of the skin can occur in addisons disease although not in secondary adrenal insufficiency this darkening is most visible on scars skin folds pressure points such as the elbows knees knuckles and toes lips and mucous membranes such as the lining of the cheek
                
the slowly progressing symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are often ignored until a stressful event such as surgery a severe injury an illness or pregnancy causes them to worsen
                
adrenal crisis
                
sudden severe worsening of adrenal insufficiency symptoms is called adrenal crisis if the person has addisons disease this worsening can also be called an addisonian crisis in most cases symptoms of adrenal insufficiency become serious enough that people seek medical treatment before an adrenal crisis occurs however sometimes symptoms appear for the first time during an adrenal crisis
                
symptoms of adrenal crisis include
                
 sudden severe pain in the lower back abdomen or legs    severe vomiting and diarrhea    dehydration    low blood pressure    loss of consciousness
                
if not treated an adrenal crisis can cause death
                

                
get treatment for adrenal crisis right away   people with adrenal insufficiency who have weakness nausea or vomiting need immediate emergency treatment to prevent an adrenal crisis and possible death an injection with a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone called a corticosteroid can save a persons life people should make sure to have a corticosteroid injection with them at all times and make sure their friends and family know how and when to give the injection   read more under how is adrenal insufficiency treated"
treatment,what are the treatments for epidermolysis bullosa ,how might infections in individuals with epidermolysis bullosa be treated the chance of contracting a skin infection can be reduced by good nutrition which builds the bodys defenses and promotes healing and by careful skin care with clean hands and use of sterile materials for added protection a doctor may recommend antibiotic ointments and soaks however even in the presence of good care it is possible for infection to develop signs of infection are redness and heat around an open area of skin pus or a yellow drainage excessive crusting on the wound surface a red line or streak under the skin that spreads away from the blistered area a wound that does not heal andor fever or chills a doctor may prescribe a specific soaking solution an antibiotic ointment or an oral antibiotic to reduce the growth of bacteria wounds that are not healing may be treated by a special wound covering or biologically developed skin more details about treatment wound care and infection control can be obtained from the emedicine and debra web sites

                     avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent lung cancer     the following are risk factors for lung cancer          cigarette cigar and pipe smoking       secondhand smoke      family history      hiv infection      environmental risk factors      beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers         the following are protective factors for lung cancer          not smoking      quitting smoking      lower exposure to workplace risk factors       lower exposure to radon         it is not clear if the following decrease the risk of lung cancer          diet      physical activity         the following do not decrease the risk of lung cancer          beta carotene supplements in nonsmokers      vitamin e supplements          cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer      new ways to prevent lung cancer are being studied in clinical trials
                
                
                    avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent lung cancer
                    avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers risk factors include smoking being overweight and not getting enough exercise increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer
                
                
                    the following are risk factors for lung cancer
                    cigarette cigar and pipe smoking      tobacco smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer cigarette cigar and pipe smoking all increase the risk of lung cancer tobacco smoking causes about  out of  cases of lung cancer in men and about  out of  cases of lung cancer in women    studies have shown that smoking low tar or low nicotine cigarettes does not lower the risk of lung cancer     studies also show that the risk of lung cancer from smoking cigarettes increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years smoked people who smoke have about  times the risk of lung cancer compared to those who do not smoke       secondhand smoke    being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke is also a risk factor for lung cancer secondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from a burning cigarette or other tobacco product or that is exhaled by smokers people who inhale secondhand smoke are exposed to the same cancer causing agents as smokers although in smaller amounts inhaling secondhand smoke is called involuntary or passive smoking       family history    having a family history of lung cancer is a risk factor for lung cancer people with a relative who has had lung cancer may be twice as likely to have lung cancer as people who do not have a relative who has had lung cancer because cigarette smoking tends to run in families and family members are exposed to secondhand smoke it is hard to know whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from the family history of lung cancer or from being exposed to cigarette smoke       hiv infection    being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids is linked with a higher risk of lung cancer people infected with hiv may have more than twice the risk of lung cancer than those who are not infected since smoking rates are higher in those infected with hiv than in those not infected it is not clear whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from hiv infection or from being exposed to cigarette smoke        environmental risk factors               radiation exposure being exposed to radiation is a risk factor for lung cancer atomic bomb radiation radiation therapy imaging tests and radon are sources of radiation exposure                    atomic bomb radiation being exposed to radiation after an atomic bomb explosion increases the risk of lung cancer        radiation therapy radiation therapy to the chest may be used to treat certain cancers including breast cancer and hodgkin lymphoma radiation therapy uses xrays gamma rays or other types of radiation that may increase the risk of lung cancer the higher the dose of radiation received the higher the risk the risk of lung cancer following radiation therapy is higher in patients who smoke than in nonsmokers        imaging tests imaging tests such as ct scans expose patients to radiation lowdose spiral ct scans expose patients to less radiation than higher dose ct scans in lung cancer screening the use of lowdose spiral ct scans can lessen the harmful effects of radiation        radon radon is a radioactive gas that comes from the breakdown of uranium in rocks and soil it seeps up through the ground and leaks into the air or water supply radon can enter homes through cracks in floors walls or the foundation and levels of radon can build up over time             studies show that high levels of radon gas inside the home or workplace increase the number of new cases of lung cancer and the number of deaths caused by lung cancer the risk of lung cancer is higher in smokers exposed to radon than in nonsmokers who are exposed to it in people who have never smoked about  of deaths caused by lung cancer have been linked to being exposed to radon       workplace exposure studies show that being exposed to the following substances increases the risk of lung cancer                    asbestos         arsenic        chromium        nickel        beryllium         cadmium        tar and soot            these substances can cause lung cancer in people who are exposed to them in the workplace and have never smoked as the level of exposure to these substances increases the risk of lung cancer also increases the risk of lung cancer is even higher in people who are exposed and also smoke        air pollution studies show that living in areas with higher levels of air pollution increases the risk of lung cancer              beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers    taking beta carotene supplements pills increases the risk of lung cancer especially in smokers who smoke one or more packs a day the risk is higher in smokers who have at least one alcoholic drink every day
                
                
                    the following are protective factors for lung cancer
                    not smoking    the best way to prevent lung cancer is to not smoke       quitting smoking    smokers can decrease their risk of lung cancer by quitting in smokers who have been treated for lung cancer quitting smoking lowers the risk of new lung cancers counseling the use of nicotine replacement products and antidepressant therapy have helped smokers quit for good    in a person who has quit smoking the chance of preventing lung cancer depends on how many years and how much the person smoked and the length of time since quitting after a person has quit smoking for  years the risk of lung cancer decreases  to     see the following for more information on quitting smoking              tobacco includes help with quitting       cigarette smoking health risks and how to quit               lower exposure to workplace risk factors     laws that protect workers from being exposed to cancercausing substances such as asbestos arsenic nickel and chromium may help lower their risk of developing lung cancer laws that prevent smoking in the workplace help lower the risk of lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke       lower exposure to radon     lowering radon levels may lower the risk of lung cancer especially among cigarette smokers high levels of radon in homes may be reduced by taking steps to prevent radon leakage such as sealing basements
                
                
                    it is not clear if the following decrease the risk of lung cancer
                    diet     some studies show that people who eat high amounts of fruits or vegetables have a lower risk of lung cancer than those who eat low amounts however since smokers tend to have less healthy diets than nonsmokers it is hard to know whether the decreased risk is from having a healthy diet or from not smoking       physical activity    some studies show that people who are physically active have a lower risk of lung cancer than people who are not however since smokers tend to have different levels of physical activity than nonsmokers it is hard to know if physical activity affects the risk of lung cancer
                
                
                    the following do not decrease the risk of lung cancer

exams and tests,how to diagnose irondeficiency anemia ,"your doctor will diagnose irondeficiency anemia based on your medical history a physical exam and the results from tests and procedures
                
once your doctor knows the cause and severity of the condition he or she can create a treatment plan for you
                
mild to moderate irondeficiency anemia may have no signs or symptoms thus you may not know you have it unless your doctor discovers it from a screening test or while checking for other problems
                
specialists involved
                
primary care doctors often diagnose and treat irondeficiency anemia these doctors include pediatricians family doctors gynecologistsobstetricians and internal medicine specialists
                
a hematologist a blood disease specialist a gastroenterologist a digestive system specialist and other specialists also may help treat irondeficiency anemia
                
medical history
                
your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms and any past problems youve had with anemia or low iron he or she also may ask about your diet and whether youre taking any medicines
                
if youre a woman your doctor may ask whether you might be pregnant
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs of irondeficiency anemia he or she may
                
look at your skin gums and nail beds to see whether theyre pale
                
listen to your heart for rapid or irregular heartbeats
                
listen to your lungs for rapid or uneven breathing
                
feel your abdomen to check the size of your liver and spleen
                
do a pelvic and rectal exam to check for internal bleeding
                
diagnostic tests and procedures
                
many tests and procedures are used to diagnose irondeficiency anemia they can help confirm a diagnosis look for a cause and find out how severe the condition is
                
complete blood count
                
often the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count cbc the cbc measures many parts of your blood
                
this test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit heematohcrit levels hemoglobin is an ironrich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood a low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia
                
the normal range of these levels varies in certain racial and ethnic populations your doctor can explain your test results to you
                
the cbc also checks the number of red blood cells white blood cells and platelets in your blood abnormal results may be a sign of infection a blood disorder or another condition
                
finally the cbc looks at mean corpuscular korpuskyular volume mcv mcv is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells the results may be a clue as to the cause of your anemia in irondeficiency anemia for example red blood cells usually are smaller than normal
                
other blood tests
                
if the cbc results confirm you have anemia you may need other blood tests to find out whats causing the condition how severe it is and the best way to treat it
                
reticulocyte count this test measures the number of reticulocytes retikulosites in your blood reticulocytes are young immature red blood cells over time reticulocytes become mature red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout your body
                
a reticulocyte count shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate
                
peripheral smear for this test a sample of your blood is examined under a microscope if you have irondeficiency anemia your red blood cells will look smaller and paler than normal
                
tests to measure iron levels these tests can show how much iron has been used from your bodys stored iron tests to measure iron levels include
                
serum iron this test measures the amount of iron in your blood the level of iron in your blood may be normal even if the total amount of iron in your body is low for this reason other iron tests also are done
                
serum ferritin ferritin is a protein that helps store iron in your body a measure of this protein helps your doctor find out how much of your bodys stored iron has been used
                
transferrin level or total ironbinding capacity transferrin is a protein that carries iron in your blood total ironbinding capacity measures how much of the transferrin in your blood isnt carrying iron if you have irondeficiency anemia youll have a high level of transferrin that has no iron
                
other tests your doctor also may recommend tests to check your hormone levels especially your thyroid hormone you also may have a blood test for a chemical called erythrocyte protoporphyrin this chemical is a building block for hemoglobin
                
children also may be tested for the level of lead in their blood lead can make it hard for the body to produce hemoglobin
                
tests and procedures for gastrointestinal blood loss
                
to check whether internal bleeding is causing your irondeficiency anemia your doctor may suggest a fecal occult blood test this test looks for blood in the stools and can detect bleeding in the intestines
                
if the test finds blood you may have other tests and procedures to find the exact spot of the bleeding these tests and procedures may look for bleeding in the stomach upper intestines colon or pelvic organs"
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to sialuria ,mutations in the gne gene cause sialuria the gne gene provides instructions for making an enzyme found in cells and tissues throughout the body this enzyme is involved in a chemical pathway that produces sialic acid which is a simple sugar that attaches to the ends of more complex molecules on the surface of cells by modifying these molecules sialic acid influences a wide variety of cellular functions including cell movement migration attachment of cells to one another adhesion signaling between cells and inflammation  the enzyme produced from the gne gene is carefully controlled to ensure that cells produce an appropriate amount of sialic acid a feedback system shuts off the enzyme when no more sialic acid is needed the mutations responsible for sialuria disrupt this feedback mechanism resulting in an overproduction of sialic acid this simple sugar builds up within cells and is excreted in urine researchers are working to determine how an accumulation of sialic acid in the body interferes with normal development in people with sialuria
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to xlinked creatine deficiency ,mutations in the  gene cause xlinked creatine deficiency the  gene provides instructions for making a protein that transports the compound creatine into cells creatine is needed for the body to store and use energy properly   gene mutations impair the ability of the transporter protein to bring creatine into cells resulting in a creatine shortage deficiency the effects of creatine deficiency are most severe in organs and tissues that require large amounts of energy especially the brain

causes,what causes peutzjeghers syndrome ,what causes peutzjeghers syndrome peutzjeghers syndrome pjs is caused by changes mutations in the  gene  is a tumor suppressor gene which means that it encodes a protein that helps keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way mutations in  result in a defective protein that is unable to carry out its normal role this leads to the development of the polyps and tumors found in pjs some people with pjs do not have mutations in the  gene in these cases the cause is unknown
inheritance,is hemifacial microsomia inherited ,is hemifacial microsomia inherited hemifacial microsomia most often occurs in a single individual in a family and is not inherited if the condition is caused by a chromosomal abnormality it may be inherited from one affected parent or it may result from a new abnormality in the chromosome and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family in a very small number of cases hemifacial microsomia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder in rare cases the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition the gene or genes involved in hemifacial microsomia are unknown in some affected families people seem to inherit an increased risk of developing hemifacial microsomia not the condition itself in these cases some combination of genetic changes and environmental factors may be involved
information,what is are diamondblackfan anemia ,diamondblackfan anemia is a disorder of the bone marrow the major function of bone marrow is to produce new blood cells in diamondblackfan anemia the bone marrow malfunctions and fails to make enough red blood cells which carry oxygen to the bodys tissues the resulting shortage of red blood cells anemia usually becomes apparent during the first year of life symptoms of anemia include fatigue weakness and an abnormally pale appearance pallor  people with diamondblackfan anemia have an increased risk of several serious complications related to their malfunctioning bone marrow specifically they have a higherthanaverage chance of developing myelodysplastic syndrome mds which is a disorder in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing certain cancers including a cancer of bloodforming tissue known as acute myeloid leukemia aml and a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma  approximately half of individuals with diamondblackfan anemia have physical abnormalities they may have an unusually small head size microcephaly and a low frontal hairline along with distinctive facial features such as wideset eyes hypertelorism droopy eyelids ptosis a broad flat bridge of the nose small lowset ears and a small lower jaw micrognathia affected individuals may also have an opening in the roof of the mouth cleft palate with or without a split in the upper lip cleft lip they may have a short webbed neck shoulder blades which are smaller and higher than usual and abnormalities of their hands most commonly malformed or absent thumbs about onethird of affected individuals have slow growth leading to short stature  other features of diamondblackfan anemia may include eye problems such as clouding of the lens of the eyes cataracts increased pressure in the eyes glaucoma or eyes that do not look in the same direction strabismus affected individuals may also have kidney abnormalities structural defects of the heart and in males the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis hypospadias  the severity of diamondblackfan anemia may vary even within the same family increasingly individuals with nonclassical diamondblackfan anemia have been identified this form of the disorder typically has less severe symptoms that may include mild anemia beginning in adulthood
treatment,what are the treatments for familial hypercholesterolemia ,how might familial hypercholesterolemia be treated the overall goal of treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia fh is to lower the risk for atherosclerosis buildup of plaque in the arteries by lowering the ldl cholesterol levels in the blood stream the first step in treatment for individuals with the heterozygous form also called the autosomal dominant form is changing the diet to reduce the total amount of fat eaten this may be accomplished by limiting the amount of beef pork and lamb in the diet cutting out butter whole milk fatty cheeses and oils and eliminating egg yolks organ meats and other sources of saturated fat from animals dietary counseling is often recommended to help individuals change their eating habits exercise and weight loss may also help in lowering cholesterol levels drug therapy is also often necessary lifestyle changes may not be enough to lower cholesterol levels several different cholesterollowering medications may be used alone or in combination they may include statins bile acid sequestrants ezetemibe niacin gemfibrozil and fenofibrate individuals with the more severe homozygous form of fh also called the autosomal recessive form need more aggressive therapies to treat their significantly elevated levels of cholesterol drug therapy is often not effective enough at lowering ldl cholesterol levels therefore individuals with this form may need periodical ldl apheresis a procedure that removes ldl from the blood in some cases major surgery such as a liver transplant is necessary

information,what is are antiphospholipid antibody syndrome ,"antiphospholipid antefosfolipid antibody syndrome aps is an autoimmune disorder autoimmune disorders occur if the bodys immune system makes antibodies that attack and damage tissues or cells
                
antibodies are a type of protein they usually help defend the body against infections in aps however the body makes antibodies that mistakenly attack phospholipidsa type of fat
                
phospholipids are found in all living cells and cell membranes including blood cells and the lining of blood vessels
                
when antibodies attack phospholipids cells are damaged this damage causes blood clots to form in the bodys arteries and veins these are the vessels that carry blood to your heart and body
                
usually blood clotting is a normal bodily process blood clots help seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls this prevents you from losing too much blood in aps however too much blood clotting can block blood flow and damage the bodys organs

some people have aps antibodies but dont ever have signs or symptoms of the disorder having aps antibodies doesnt mean that you have aps to be diagnosed with aps you must have aps antibodies and a history of health problems related to the disorder
                
aps can lead to many health problems such as stroke heart attack kidney damage deep vein thrombosis thrombosis and pulmonary embolism pullmunary embolizm
                
aps also can cause pregnancyrelated problems such as multiple miscarriages a miscarriage late in pregnancy or a premature birth due to eclampsia eklampseah eclampsia which follows preeclampsia is a serious condition that causes seizures in pregnant women
                
very rarely some people who have aps develop many blood clots within weeks or months this condition is called catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome caps
                
people who have aps also are at higher risk for thrombocytopenia thrombositopeneah this is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of blood cell fragments called platelets platelets antibodies destroy the platelets or theyre used up during the clotting process mild to serious bleeding can occur with thrombocytopenia
                
aps can be fatal death may occur as a result of large blood clots or blood clots in the heart lungs or brain
                
outlook
                
aps can affect people of any age however its more common in women and people who have other autoimmune or rheumatic rumatik disorders such as lupus rheumatic refers to disorders that affect the joints bones or muscles
                
aps has no cure but medicines can help prevent its complications medicines are used to stop blood clots from forming they also are used to keep existing clots from getting larger treatment for aps is long term
                
if you have aps and another autoimmune disorder its important to control that condition as well when the other condition is controlled aps may cause fewer problems"

information,what is are behet disease ,behet disease is an inflammatory condition that affects many parts of the body the health problems associated with behet disease result from widespread inflammation of blood vessels vasculitis this inflammation most commonly affects the mouth genitals skin and eyes  painful mouth sores called aphthous ulcers are usually the first sign of behet disease these sores occur on the lips and tongue and inside the cheeks the ulcers look like common canker sores and they typically heal within one to two weeks about  percent of all people with behet disease develop similar ulcers on the genitals these ulcers occur most frequently on the scrotum in men and on the labia in women  behet disease can also cause painful bumps and sores on the skin most affected individuals develop pusfilled bumps that resemble acne these bumps can occur anywhere on the body some affected people also have red tender nodules called erythema nodosum these nodules usually develop on the legs but can also occur on the face neck and arms  an inflammation of the eye called uveitis is found in more than half of people with behet disease eye problems are more common in younger people with the disease and affect men more often than women uveitis can result in blurry vision and an extreme sensitivity to light photophobia rarely inflammation can also cause eye pain and redness if untreated the eye problems associated with behet disease can lead to blindness  less commonly behet disease can affect the joints gastrointestinal tract large blood vessels and brain and spinal cord central nervous system central nervous system abnormalities are among the most serious complications of behet disease related symptoms can include headaches confusion personality changes memory loss impaired speech and problems with balance and movement  the signs and symptoms of behet disease usually begin in a persons twenties or thirties although they can appear at any age some affected people have relatively mild symptoms that are limited to sores in the mouth and on the genitals others have more severe symptoms affecting many parts of the body including the central nervous system the features of behet disease typically come and go over a period of months or years in most affected individuals the health problems associated with this disorder improve with age
information,what is are hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type v ,hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type v  is a condition that primarily affects the sensory nerve cells sensory neurons which transmit information about sensations such as pain temperature and touch these sensations are impaired in people with   the signs and symptoms of  appear early usually at birth or during infancy people with  lose the ability to feel pain heat and cold deep pain perception the feeling of pain from injuries to bones ligaments or muscles is especially affected in people with  because of the inability to feel deep pain affected individuals suffer repeated severe injuries such as bone fractures and joint injuries that go unnoticed repeated trauma can lead to a condition called charcot joints in which the bones and tissue surrounding joints are destroyed
outlook,what is the outlook for retinoblastoma ,the prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options depend on the following          whether the cancer is in one or both eyes     the size and number of tumors     whether the tumor has spread to the area around the eye to the brain or to other parts of the body     whether there are symptoms at the time of diagnosis for trilateral retinoblastoma     the age of the child     how likely it is that vision can be saved in one or both eyes     whether a second type of cancer has formed
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to pyridoxal  epilepsy ,mutations in the pnpo gene cause pyridoxal  epilepsy the pnpo gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called pyridoxine  oxidase this enzyme is involved in the conversion metabolism of vitamin  derived from food in the form of pyridoxine and pyridoxamine to the active form of vitamin  called pyridoxal  plp plp is necessary for many processes in the body including protein metabolism and the production of chemicals that transmit signals in the brain neurotransmitters  pnpo gene mutations result in a pyridoxine  oxidase enzyme that is unable to metabolize pyridoxine and pyridoxamine leading to a deficiency of plp a shortage of plp can disrupt the function of many other proteins and enzymes that need plp in order to be effective it is not clear how the lack of plp affects the brain and leads to the seizures that are characteristic of pyridoxal  epilepsy
information,what is are waldenstrm macroglobulinemia ,waldenstrm macroglobulinemia is a rare blood cell cancer characterized by an excess of abnormal white blood cells called lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow this condition is classified as a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma the abnormal cells have characteristics of both white blood cells lymphocytes called b cells and of more mature cells derived from b cells known as plasma cells these abnormal cells produce excess amounts of igm a type of protein known as an immunoglobulin the overproduction of this large protein is how the condition got its name macroglobulinemia  waldenstrm macroglobulinemia usually begins in a persons sixties and is a slowgrowing indolent cancer some affected individuals have elevated levels of igm and lymphoplasmacytic cells but no symptoms of the condition in these cases the disease is usually found incidentally by a blood test taken for another reason these individuals are diagnosed with smoldering or asymptomatic waldenstrm macroglobulinemia it can be several years before this form of the condition progresses to the symptomatic form  individuals with symptomatic waldenstrm macroglobulinemia can experience general symptoms such as fever night sweats and weight loss several other signs and symptoms of the condition are related to the excess igm which can thicken blood and impair circulation causing a condition known as hyperviscosity syndrome features related to hyperviscosity syndrome include bleeding in the nose or mouth blurring or loss of vision headache dizziness and difficulty coordinating movements ataxia in some affected individuals the igm proteins clump together in the hands and feet where the body temperature is cooler than at the center of the body these proteins are then referred to as cryoglobulins and their clumping causes a condition known as cryoglobulinemia cryoglobulinemia can lead to pain in the hands and feet or episodes of raynaud phenomenon in which the fingers and toes turn white or blue in response to cold temperatures the igm protein can also build up in organs such as the heart and kidneys causing a condition called amyloidosis which can lead to heart and kidney problems some people with waldenstrm macroglobulinemia develop a loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs peripheral neuropathy doctors are unsure why this feature occurs although they speculate that the igm protein attaches to the protective covering of nerve cells myelin and breaks it down the damaged nerves cannot carry signals normally leading to neuropathy  other features of waldenstrm macroglobulinemia are due to the accumulation of lymphoplasmacytic cells in different tissues for example accumulation of these cells can lead to an enlarged liver hepatomegaly spleen splenomegaly or lymph nodes lymphadenopathy in the bone marrow the lymphoplasmacytic cells interfere with normal blood cell development causing a shortage of normal blood cells pancytopenia excessive tiredness fatigue due to a reduction in red blood cells anemia is common in affected individuals  people with waldenstrm macroglobulinemia have an increased risk of developing other cancers of the blood or other tissues
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to multiple sulfatase deficiency ,multiple sulfatase deficiency is caused by mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called formylglycinegenerating enzyme fge this enzyme is found in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum which is involved in protein processing and transport the fge enzyme modifies other enzymes called sulfatases which aid in breaking down substances that contain chemical groups known as sulfates these substances include a variety of sugars fats and hormones  most  gene mutations severely reduce the function of the fge enzyme or lead to the production of an unstable enzyme that is quickly broken down the activity of multiple sulfatases is impaired because the fge enzyme modifies all known sulfatase enzymes sulfatecontaining molecules that are not broken down build up in cells often resulting in cell death the death of cells in particular tissues specifically the brain skeleton and skin cause many of the signs and symptoms of multiple sulfatase deficiency  research indicates that mutations that lead to reduced fge enzyme function are associated with the less severe cases of the condition whereas mutations that lead to the production of an unstable fge enzyme tend to be associated with the more severe cases of multiple sulfatase deficiency
treatment,what are the treatments for urinary incontinence in men ,"treatment depends on the type of ui
                
urgency incontinence
                
as a first line of therapy for urgency incontinence a health care professional may recommend the following techniques to treat a mans problem
                
 behavioral and lifestyle changes   bladder training   pelvic floor exercises   urgency suppression
                
if those treatments are not successful the following additional measures may help urgency incontinence
                
 medications   electrical nerve stimulation   bulking agents   surgery
                
a health care professional may recommend other treatments for men with urgency incontinence caused by bph more information is provided in the niddk health topic prostate enlargement benign prostatic hyperplasia
                
behavioral and lifestyle changes men with urgency incontinence may be able to reduce leaks by making behavioral and lifestyle changes
                
 eating diet and nutrition men with urgency incontinence can change the amount and type of liquid they drink a man can try limiting bladder irritantsincluding caffeinated drinks such as tea or coffee and carbonated beveragesto decrease leaks men also should limit alcoholic drinks which can increase urine production a health care professional can help a man determine how much he should drink based on his health how active he is and where he lives to decrease nighttime trips to the restroom men may want to stop drinking liquids several hours before bed   engaging in physical activity although a man may be reluctant to engage in physical activity when he has urgency incontinence regular exercise is important for good overall health and for preventing and treating ui   losing weight men who are overweight should talk with a health care professional about strategies for losing weight which can help improve ui   preventing constipation gastrointestinal gi problems especially constipation can make urinary tract health worse and can lead to ui the opposite is also true urinary problems such as ui can make gi problems worse more information about how to prevent constipation through diet and physical activity is provided in the niddk health topic constipation
                

                
to help prevent bladder problems stop smoking   people who smoke should stop quitting smoking at any age promotes bladder health and overall health smoking increases a persons chance of developing stress incontinence as it increases coughing some people say smoking worsens their bladder irritation smoking causes most cases of bladder cancer people who smoke for many years have a higher risk of bladder cancer than nonsmokers or those who smoke for a short  people who smoke should ask for help so they do not have to try quitting alone call   for more information
                
bladder training bladder training is changing urination habits to decrease incidents of ui the health care professional may suggest a man use the restroom at regular timed intervals called timed voiding based on the mans bladder diary a man can gradually lengthen the time between trips to the restroom to help stretch the bladder so it can hold more urine
                
pelvic floor muscle exercises pelvic floor muscle or kegel exercises involve strengthening pelvic floor muscles strong pelvic floor muscles hold in urine more effectively than weak muscles a man does not need special equipment for kegel exercises the exercises involve tightening and relaxing the muscles that control urine flow pelvic floor exercises should not be performed during urination a health care professional can help a man learn proper technique more information is provided in the niddk health topic kegel exercise tips
                
men also may learn how to perform kegel exercises properly by using biofeedback biofeedback uses special sensors to measure bodily functions such as muscle contractions that control urination a video monitor displays the measurements as graphs and sounds indicate when the man is using the correct muscles the health care professional uses the information to help the man change abnormal function of the pelvic floor muscles at home the man practices to improve muscle function the man can perform the exercises while lying down sitting at a desk or standing up success with pelvic floor exercises depends on the cause of ui its severity and the mans ability to perform the exercises
                
urgency suppression by using certain techniques a man can suppress the urge to urinate called urgency suppression urgency suppression is a way for a man to train his bladder to maintain control so he does not have to panic about finding a restroom some men use distraction techniques to take their mind off the urge to urinate other men find taking long relaxing breaths and being still can help doing pelvic floor exercises also can help suppress the urge to urinate
                
medications health care professionals may prescribe medications that relax the bladder decrease bladder spasms or treat prostate enlargement to treat urgency incontinence in men
                
 antimuscarinics antimuscarinics can help relax bladder muscles and prevent bladder spasms these medications include oxybutynin oxytrol tolterodine detrol darifenacin enablex trospium sanctura fesoterodine toviaz and solifenacin vesicare they are available in pill liquid and patch form   tricyclic antidepressants tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine tofranil can calm nerve signals decreasing spasms in bladder muscles   alphablockers terazosin hytrin doxazosin cardura tamsulosin flomax alfuzosin uroxatral and silodosin rapaflo are used to treat problems caused by prostate enlargement and bladder outlet obstruction these medications relax the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck which lets urine flow normally and prevents abnormal bladder contractions that can lead to urgency incontinence    reductase inhibitors finasteride proscar and dutasteride avodart block the production of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone which accumulates in the prostate and may cause prostate growth these medications may help to relieve urgency incontinence problems by shrinking an enlarged prostate    agonists mirabegron myrbetriq is a  agonist a person takes by mouth to help prevent symptoms of urgency incontinence mirabegron suppresses involuntary bladder contractions   botox a health care professional may use onabotulinumtoxina botox also called botulinum toxin type a to treat ui in men with neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis injecting botox into the bladder relaxes the bladder increasing storage capacity and decreasing ui a health care professional performs the procedure during an office visit a man receives local anesthesia the health care professional uses a cystoscope to guide the needle for injecting the botox botox is effective for up to  
                
electrical nerve stimulation if behavioral and lifestyle changes and medications do not improve symptoms a urologist may suggest electrical nerve stimulation as an option to prevent ui urinary frequencyurination more often than normaland other symptoms electrical nerve stimulation involves altering bladder reflexes using pulses of electricity the two most common types of electrical nerve stimulation are percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation and sacral nerve 
                
 percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation uses electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve which is located in the ankle on a weekly basis the patient receives local anesthesia for the procedure in an outpatient center a urologist inserts a batteryoperated stimulator beneath the skin near the tibial nerve electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve prevents bladder activity by interfering with the pathway between the bladder and the spinal cord or brain although researchers consider percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation safe they continue to study the exact ways that it prevents symptoms and how long the treatment can last   sacral nerve stimulation involves implanting a batteryoperated stimulator beneath the skin in the lower back near the sacral nerve the procedure takes place in an outpatient center using local anesthesia based on the patients feedback the health care professional can adjust the amount of stimulation so it works best for that individual the electrical pulses enter the body for minutes to hours two or more times a day either through wires placed on the lower back or just above the pubic areabetween the navel and the pubic hair sacral nerve stimulation may increase blood flow to the bladder strengthen pelvic muscles that help control the bladder and trigger the release of natural substances that block pain the patient can turn the stimulator on or off at any time

stages,what are the stages of extragonadal germ cell tumors ,"key points
                     after an extragonadal germ cell tumor has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body      there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body     cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body      the following prognostic groups are used for extragonadal germ cell tumors          good prognosis      intermediate prognosis      poor prognosis
                
                
                    after an extragonadal germ cell tumor has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body
                    the extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages for extragonadal germ cell tumors prognostic groups are used instead of stages the tumors are grouped according to how well the cancer is expected to respond to treatment it is important to know the prognostic group in order to plan treatment
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body
                    cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood          tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas      lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body      blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood          lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body     blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body        the metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor for example if an extragonadal germ cell tumor spreads to the lung the tumor cells in the lung are actually cancerous germ cells the disease is metastatic extragonadal germ cell tumor not lung cancer
                
                
                    the following prognostic groups are used for extragonadal germ cell tumors
                    good prognosis    a nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the good prognosis group if              the tumor is in the back of the abdomen and      the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs and      the levels of tumor markers afp and hcg are normal and ldh is slightly above normal           a seminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the good prognosis group if             the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs and      the level of afp is normal hcg and ldh may be at any level              intermediate prognosis    a nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the intermediate prognosis group if              the tumor is in the back of the abdomen and      the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs and      the level of any one of the tumor markers afp hcg or ldh is more than slightly above normal           a seminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the intermediate prognosis group if             the tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs and      the level of afp is normal hcg and ldh may be at any level              poor prognosis    a nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the poor prognosis group if             the tumor is in the chest or       the tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs or      the level of any one of the tumor markers afp hcg or ldh is high            seminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor does not have a poor prognosis group"

treatment,what are the treatments for collagenous colitis ,how might collagenous colitis be treated treatment for collagenous colitis varies depending on the symptoms and severity in each affected individual in some cases the condition may resolve on its own spontaneous remission although most people continue to have ongoing or occasional diarrhea dietary changes are usually tried first to alleviate symptoms these changes may include a reducedfat diet eliminating foods that contain caffeine and lactose and avoiding overthecounter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or aspirin if these changes alone are not enough medications can be used to help control symptoms however the response rate to various types of medication reportedly varies prescription antiinflammatory medications such as mesalamine and sulfasalazine may help reduce swelling steroids including budesonide and prednisone can be used reduce inflammation but they are usually only used to control sudden attacks of diarrhea longterm use of steroids is typically avoided because of unwanted side effects antidiarrheal medications such as bismuth subsalicylate diphenoxylate with atropine and loperamide can offer shortterm relief immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine help to reduce inflammation but are rarely needed in extreme cases where the condition does not respond to medications surgery to remove all or part of the colon may be necessary however surgery is rarely recommended
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to acute promyelocytic leukemia ,the mutation that causes acute promyelocytic leukemia involves two genes the pml gene on chromosome  and the rara gene on chromosome  a rearrangement of genetic material translocation between chromosomes  and  written as  fuses part of the pml gene with part of the rara gene the protein produced from this fused gene is known as pmlrar this mutation is acquired during a persons lifetime and is present only in certain cells this type of genetic change called a somatic mutation is not inherited  the pmlrar protein functions differently than the protein products of the normal pml and rara genes the protein produced from the rara gene rar is involved in the regulation of gene transcription which is the first step in protein production specifically this protein helps control the transcription of certain genes important in the maturation differentiation of white blood cells beyond the promyelocyte stage the protein produced from the pml gene acts as a tumor suppressor which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way the pmlrar protein interferes with the normal function of both the pml and the rar proteins as a result blood cells are stuck at the promyelocyte stage and they proliferate abnormally excess promyelocytes accumulate in the bone marrow and normal white blood cells cannot form leading to acute promyelocytic leukemia  the pmlrara gene fusion accounts for up to  percent of cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia translocations involving the rara gene and other genes have been identified in a few cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia

susceptibility,who is at risk for arrhythmia ,"arrhythmias are very common in older adults atrial fibrillation a common type of arrhythmia that can cause problems affects millions of people and the number is rising
                
most serious arrhythmias affect people older than  this is because older adults are more likely to have heart disease and other health problems that can lead to arrhythmias
                
older adults also tend to be more sensitive to the side effects of medicines some of which can cause arrhythmias some medicines used to treat arrhythmias can even cause arrhythmias as a side effect
                
some types of arrhythmia happen more often in children and young adults paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia psvt including wolffparkinsonwhite syndrome is more common in young people psvt is a fast heart rate that begins and ends suddenly
                
major risk factors
                
arrhythmias are more common in people who have diseases or conditions that weaken the heart such as
                
heart attack
                
heart failure or cardiomyopathy which weakens the heart and changes the way electrical signals move through the heart
                
heart tissue thats too thick or stiff or that hasnt formed normally
                
leaking or narrowed heart valves which make the heart work too hard and can lead to heart failure
                
congenital heart defects defects present at birth that affect the hearts structure or function
                
other conditions also can raise the risk for arrhythmias such as
                
high blood pressure
                
infections that damage the heart muscle or the sac around the heart
                
diabetes which increases the risk of high blood pressure and coronary heart disease
                
sleep apnea which can stress the heart because the heart doesnt get enough oxygen
                
an overactive or underactive thyroid gland too much or too little thyroid hormone in the body
                
several other risk factors also can raise your risk for arrhythmias examples include heart surgery certain drugs such as cocaine or amphetamines or an imbalance of chemicals or other substances such as potassium in the bloodstream"

stages,what are the stages of prostate cancer ,"key points
                     after prostate cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the prostate or to other parts of the body      there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body     cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body     the following stages are used for prostate cancer          stage i      stage ii      stage iii      stage iv
                
                
                    after prostate cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the prostate or to other parts of the body
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the prostate or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment the results of the tests used to diagnose prostate cancer are often also used to stage the disease see the general information section in prostate cancer staging tests may not be done unless the patient has symptoms or signs that the cancer has spread such as bone pain a high psa level or a high gleason score   the following tests and procedures also may be used in the staging process            bone scan  a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells in the bone a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream the radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner        mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri       ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography       pelvic lymphadenectomy  a surgical procedure to remove the lymph nodes in the pelvis a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells       seminal vesicle biopsy  the removal of fluid from the seminal vesicles glands that make semen using a needle a pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells       prostascint scan  a procedure to check for cancer that has spread from the prostate to other parts of the body such as the lymph nodes a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream the radioactive material attaches to prostate cancer cells and is detected by a scanner the radioactive material shows up as a bright spot on the picture in areas where there are a lot of prostate cancer cells        the stage of the cancer is based on the results of the staging and diagnostic tests including the prostatespecific antigen psa test and the gleason score the tissue samples removed during the biopsy are used to find out the gleason score the gleason score ranges from  and describes how different the cancer cells look from normal cells and how likely it is that the tumor will spread the lower the number the less likely the tumor is to spread
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body
                    cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood          tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas      lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body      blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood          lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body     blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if prostate cancer spreads to the bone the cancer cells in the bone are actually prostate cancer cells the disease is metastatic prostate cancer not bone cancer    denosumab a monoclonal antibody may be used to prevent bone metastases
                
                
                    the following stages are used for prostate cancer
                    stage i    in stage i cancer is found in the prostate only the cancer              is found by needle biopsy done for a high psa level or in a small amount of tissue during surgery for other reasons such as benign prostatic hyperplasia the psa level is lower than  and the gleason score is  or lower or      is found in onehalf or less of one lobe of the prostate the psa level is lower than  and the gleason score is  or lower or      cannot be felt during a digital rectal exam and cannot be seen in imaging tests cancer is found in onehalf or less of one lobe of the prostate the psa level and the gleason score are not known               stage ii    in stage ii cancer is more advanced than in stage i but has not spread outside the prostate stage ii is divided into stages iia and iib    in stage iia cancer              is found by needle biopsy done for a high psa level or in a small amount of tissue during surgery for other reasons such as benign prostatic hyperplasia the psa level is lower than  and the gleason score is  or       is found by needle biopsy done for a high psa level or in a small amount of tissue during surgery for other reasons such as benign prostatic hyperplasia the psa level is at least  but lower than  and the gleason score is  or lower or      is found in onehalf or less of one lobe of the prostate the psa level is at least  but lower than  and the gleason score is  or lower or      is found in onehalf or less of one lobe of the prostate the psa level is lower than  and the gleason score is  or      is found in more than onehalf of one lobe of the prostate            in stage iib cancer             is found in opposite sides of the prostate the psa can be any level and the gleason score can range from  to  or      cannot be felt during a digital rectal exam and cannot be seen in imaging tests the psa level is  or higher and the gleason score can range from  to  or      cannot be felt during a digital rectal exam and cannot be seen in imaging tests the psa can be any level and the gleason score is  or higher              stage iii    in stage iii cancer has spread beyond the outer layer of the prostate and may have spread to the seminal vesicles the psa can be any level and the gleason score can range from  to        stage iv    in stage iv the psa can be any level and the gleason score can range from  to  also cancer             has spread beyond the seminal vesicles to nearby tissue or organs such as the rectum bladder or pelvic wall or       may have spread to the seminal vesicles or to nearby tissue or organs such as the rectum bladder or pelvic wall cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or      has spread to distant parts of the body which may include lymph nodes or bones prostate cancer often spreads to the bones"
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to thanatophoric dysplasia ,mutations in the  gene cause thanatophoric dysplasia both types of this condition result from mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue mutations in this gene cause the  protein to be overly active which leads to the severe disturbances in bone growth that are characteristic of thanatophoric dysplasia it is not known how  mutations cause the brain and skin abnormalities associated with this disorder

treatment,what are the treatments for squamous cell carcinoma ,how might squamous cell carcinoma be treated skin cancer generally has a high cure rate if it is treated early treatment depends on how big the tumor is its location and how far it has spread metastasis methods of treatment for squamous cell carcinoma may include curettage and desiccation  scraping away the cancer and using electricity to kill any remaining cancer cells this is used to treat cancers that are not very large or deep surgical excision  cutting out of the tumor and stitching up the remaining tissue radiation therapy if the skin cancer is located in an area difficult to treat surgically microscopically controlled excision mohs surgery  repeated cutting out of small pieces of tissue that are then examined microscopically to check if any cancer has been left behind repeated application of this technique minimizes the removal of healthy tissue and is cosmetically more satisfying especially if carried out with a plastic surgeon as part of the medical team this is more likely to be used for skin cancers on the nose ears and other areas of the face cryosurgery  freezing and killing the cancer cells skin creams and medications  may be used to treat superficial not very deep squamous cell carcinoma the outlook for small squamous cell lesions that are removed early and completely is extremely favorable with about  cured if they are removed promptly
treatment,what are the treatments for celiac artery compression syndrome ,how might celiac artery compression syndrome be treated surgery is currently the only treatment option for celiac artery compression syndrome surgery typically involves decompression of the celiac artery by dividing the fibers of the median arcuate ligament and celiac plexus network of nerves in the abdomen surgical decompression might additionally be combined with stent placement angioplasty or vascular reconstruction of the celiac artery
inheritance,is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura inherited ,the familial form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition  the acquired form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is not inherited

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to costello syndrome ,mutations in the hras gene cause costello syndrome this gene provides instructions for making a protein called hras which is part of a pathway that helps control cell growth and division mutations that cause costello syndrome lead to the production of an hras protein that is abnormally turned on active the overactive protein directs cells to grow and divide constantly which can lead to the development of cancerous and noncancerous tumors it is unclear how mutations in the hras gene cause the other features of costello syndrome but many of the signs and symptoms probably result from cell overgrowth and abnormal cell division  some people with signs and symptoms of costello syndrome do not have an identified mutation in the hras gene these individuals may actually have cfc syndrome or noonan syndrome which are caused by mutations in related genes the proteins produced from these genes interact with one another and with the hras protein as part of the same cell growth and division pathway these interactions help explain why mutations in different genes can cause conditions with overlapping signs and symptoms
information,what is are childbirth ,when you are ready to have your baby youll go through labor contractions let you know labor is starting when contractions are five minutes apart your body is ready to push the baby out    during the first stage of labor your cervix slowly opens or dilates to about  inches wide at the same time it becomes thinner this is called effacement you shouldnt push until your uterus is fully effaced and dilated when it is the baby delivery stage starts crowning is when your babys scalp comes into view shortly afterward your baby is born the placenta that nourished the baby follows    mothers and babies are monitored closely during labor most women are healthy enough to have a baby through normal vaginal delivery meaning that the baby comes down the birth canal without surgery if there are complications the baby may need to be delivered surgically by a cesarean section     dept of health and human services office on womens health

considerations,what to do for fecal incontinence ,"dietary changes that may improve fecal incontinence include
                
 eating the right amount of fiber fiber can help with diarrhea and constipation fiber is found in fruits vegetables whole grains and beans fiber supplements sold in a pharmacy or in a health food store are another common source of fiber to treat fecal incontinence the academy of nutrition and dietetics recommends consuming  to  grams of fiber a day for adults and age plus five grams for children a  child for example should get  plus five or  grams of fiber a day american adults consume only  grams a day on  fiber should be added to the diet slowly to avoid bloating   getting plenty to drink drinking eight  glasses of liquid a day may help prevent constipation water is a good choice drinks with caffeine alcohol milk or carbonation should be avoided if they trigger diarrhea
                
keeping a food diary   a food diary can help identify foods that cause diarrhea and increase the risk of fecal incontinence a food diary should list foods eaten portion size and when fecal incontinence occurs after a few days the diary may show a link between certain foods and fecal incontinence eating less of foods linked to fecal incontinence may improve symptoms a food diary can also be helpful to a health care provider treating a person with fecal incontinence   common foods and drinks linked to fecal incontinence include    dairy products such as milk cheese and ice cream    drinks and foods containing caffeine    cured or smoked meat such as sausage ham and turkey    spicy foods    alcoholic beverages    fruits such as apples peaches and pears    fatty and greasy foods    sweeteners in diet drinks and sugarless gum and candy including sorbitol xylitol mannitol and fructose
                

                
examples of foods that have fiber        beans cereals and breads    fiber         cup of beans navy pinto kidney etc cooked     grams         cup of shredded wheat readytoeat cereal     grams         cup of  bran readytoeat cereal     grams         small oat bran muffin     grams         wholewheat english muffin     grams        fruits         small apple with skin     grams         medium pear with skin     grams         cup of raspberries     grams         cup of stewed prunes     grams        vegetables         cup of winter squash cooked     grams          medium sweet potato baked in skin     grams         cup of green peas cooked     grams         small potato baked with skin     grams         cup of mixed vegetables cooked     grams         cup of broccoli cooked     grams          cup of greens spinach collards turnip greens cooked     grams
                

                
medications
                
if diarrhea is causing fecal incontinence medication may help health care providers sometimes recommend using bulk laxatives such as citrucel and metamucil to develop more solid stools that are easier to control antidiarrheal medications such as loperamide or diphenoxylate may be recommended to slow down the bowels and help control the problem
                
bowel training
                
developing a regular bowel movement pattern can improve fecal incontinence especially fecal incontinence due to constipation bowel training involves trying to have bowel movements at specific times of the day such as after every meal over time the body becomes used to a regular bowel movement pattern thus reducing constipation and related fecal incontinence persistence is key to successful bowel training achieving a regular bowel control pattern can take weeks to months
                
pelvic floor exercises and biofeedback
                
exercises that strengthen the pelvic floor muscles may improve bowel control pelvic floor exercises involve squeezing and relaxing pelvic floor muscles  to  times a day a health care provider can help with proper technique biofeedback therapy may also help a person perform the exercises properly this therapy also improves a persons awareness of sensations in the rectum teaching how to coordinate squeezing of the external sphincter muscle with the sensation of rectal filling biofeedback training uses special sensors to measure bodily functions sensors include pressure or emg sensors in the anus pressure sensors in the rectum and a balloon in the rectum to produce graded sensations of rectal fullness the measurements are displayed on a video screen as sounds or line graphs the health care provider uses the information to help the person modify or change abnormal function the person practices the exercises at home success with pelvic floor exercises depends on the cause of fecal incontinence its severity and the persons motivation and ability to follow the health care providers recommendations
                
surgery
                
surgery may be an option for fecal incontinence that fails to improve with other treatments or for fecal incontinence caused by pelvic floor or anal sphincter muscle injuries
                
 sphincteroplasty the most common fecal incontinence surgery reconnects the separated ends of a sphincter muscle torn by childbirth or another injury sphincteroplasty is performed at a hospital by a colorectal gynecological or general surgeon   artificial anal sphincter involves placing an inflatable cuff around the anus and implanting a small pump beneath the skin that the person activates to inflate or deflate the cuff this surgery is much less common and is performed at a hospital by a specially trained colorectal surgeon   nonabsorbable bulking agents can be injected into the wall of the anus to bulk up the tissue around the anus the bulkier tissues make the opening of the anus narrower so the sphincters are able to close better the procedure is performed in a health care providers office anesthesia is not needed the person can return to normal physical activities  week after the procedure   bowel diversion is an operation that reroutes the normal movement of stool out of the body when part of the bowel is removed the operation diverts the lower part of the small intestine or colon to an opening in the wall of the abdomenthe area between the chest and hips an external pouch is attached to the opening to collect stool the procedure is performed by a surgeon in a hospital and anesthesia is used more information about these procedures can be found in the bowel diversion fact sheet
                
electrical stimulation
                
electrical stimulation also called sacral nerve stimulation or neuromodulation involves placing electrodes in the sacral nerves to the anus and rectum and continuously stimulating the nerves with electrical pulses the sacral nerves connect to the part of the spine in the hip area a batteryoperated stimulator is placed beneath the skin based on the persons response the health care provider can adjust the amount of stimulation so it works best for that person the person can turn the stimulator on or off at any time the procedure is performed in an outpatient center using local anesthesia"

causes,what causes hypothyroidism ,"hypothyroidism has several causes including
                
 hashimotos disease   thyroiditis or inflammation of the thyroid   congenital hypothyroidism or hypothyroidism that is present at birth   surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid   radiation treatment of the thyroid   some medications
                
less commonly hypothyroidism is caused by too much or too little iodine in the diet or by abnormalities of the pituitary gland
                
hashimotos disease
                
hashimotos disease also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the united  hashimotos disease is a form of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland hashimotos disease is also an autoimmune disorder
                
normally the immune system protects the body against foreign invaderssuch as viruses and bacteriathat can cause illness but in autoimmune diseases the immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs with hashimotos disease the immune system attacks the thyroid causing inflammation and interfering with its ability to produce thyroid hormones
                
more information is provided in the niddk health topic hashimotos disease
                
thyroiditis
                
thyroiditis causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of the thyroid gland at first the leakage raises hormone levels in the blood leading to hyperthyroidismwhen thyroid hormone levels are too highthat lasts for  or  months most people then develop hypothyroidism before the thyroid is completely healed
                
several types of thyroiditis can cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism
                
 subacute thyroiditis this condition involves painful inflammation and enlargement of the thyroid experts are not sure what causes subacute thyroiditis but it may be related to a viral or bacterial infection the condition usually goes away on its own in a few months   postpartum thyroiditis this type of thyroiditis develops after a woman gives birth for more information see the section titled what happens with pregnancy and thyroid conditions   silent thyroiditis this type of thyroiditis is called silent because it is painless as is postpartum thyroiditis even though the thyroid may be enlarged like postpartum thyroiditis silent thyroiditis is probably an autoimmune condition and sometimes develops into permanent hypothyroidism
                
congenital hypothyroidism
                
some babies are born with a thyroid that is not fully developed or does not function properly if untreated congenital hypothyroidism can lead to mental retardation and growth failure early treatment can prevent these complications so most newborns in the united states are screened for hypothyroidism
                
surgical removal of the thyroid
                
when part of the thyroid is removed the remaining part may produce normal amounts of thyroid hormone but some people who have this surgery develop hypothyroidism removal of the entire thyroid always results in hypothyroidism
                
part or all of the thyroid may be surgically removed as a treatment for
                
 hyperthyroidism   a large goiter which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to appear swollen and can interfere with normal breathing and swallowing   thyroid nodules which are noncancerous tumors called adenomas or lumps in the thyroid that can produce excess thyroid hormone   thyroid cancer
                
radiation treatment of the thyroid
                
radioactive iodine a common treatment for hyperthyroidism gradually destroys the cells of the thyroid most people who receive radioactive iodine treatment eventually develop hypothyroidism people with hodgkins disease other lymphomas and head or neck cancers are treated with radiation which can also damage the thyroid
                
medications
                
some drugs can interfere with thyroid hormone production and lead to hypothyroidism including
                
 amiodarone a heart medication   interferon alpha a cancer medication   lithium a bipolar disorder medication    a kidney cancer medication"

research,what research or clinical trials is being done for breast cancer ,"other screening tests are being studied in clinical trials
                    thermography     thermography is a procedure in which a special camera that senses heat is used to record the temperature of the skin that covers the breasts a computer makes a map of the breast showing the changes in temperature tumors can cause temperature changes that may show up on the thermogram     there have been no clinical trials of thermography to find out how well it detects breast cancer or if having the procedure decreases the risk of dying from breast cancer       tissue sampling    breast tissue sampling is taking cells from breast tissue to check under a microscope abnormal cells in breast fluid have been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in some studies scientists are studying whether breast tissue sampling can be used to find breast cancer at an early stage or predict the risk of developing breast cancer three ways of taking tissue samples are being studied              fineneedle aspiration a thin needle is inserted into the breast tissue around the areola darkened area around the nipple to take out a sample of cells and fluid      nipple aspiration the use of gentle suction to collect fluid through the nipple this is done with a device similar to the breast pumps used by women who are breastfeeding       ductal lavage a hairsize catheter tube is inserted into the nipple and a small amount of salt water is released into the duct the water picks up breast cells and is removed               screening clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the nci website"
causes,what causes sarcoidosis ,"the cause of sarcoidosis isnt known more than one factor may play a role in causing the disease
                
some researchers think that sarcoidosis develops if your immune system responds to a trigger such as bacteria viruses dust or chemicals
                
normally your immune system defends your body against foreign or harmful substances for example it sends special cells to protect organs that are in danger
                
these cells release chemicals that recruit other cells to isolate and destroy the harmful substance inflammation occurs during this process once the harmful substance is gone the cells and the inflammation go away
                
in people who have sarcoidosis the inflammation doesnt go away instead some of the immune system cells cluster to form lumps called granulomas in various organs in your body
                
genetics also may play a role in sarcoidosis researchers believe that sarcoidosis occurs if
                
you have a certain gene or genes that raise your risk for the disease
                
and
                
youre exposed to something that triggers your immune system

                    there are different types of treatment for patients with metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    two types of standard treatment are used
                    surgery      surgery may include neck dissection there are different types of neck dissection based on the amount of tissue that is removed              radical neck dissection surgery to remove tissues in one or both sides of the neck between the jawbone and the collarbone including the following                   all lymph nodes        the jugular vein        muscles and nerves that are used for face neck and shoulder movement speech and swallowing            the patient may need physical therapy of the throat neck shoulder andor arm after radical neck dissection radical neck dissection may be used when cancer has spread widely in the neck       modified radical neck dissection surgery to remove all the lymph nodes in one or both sides of the neck without removing the neck muscles the nerves andor the jugular vein may be removed       partial neck dissection surgery to remove some of the lymph nodes in the neck this is also called selective neck dissection            even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of surgery some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy       radiation therapy     radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy              external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue this type of radiation therapy may include the following                    intensitymodulated radiation therapy imrt imrt is a type of   radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor thin beams of radiation of different intensities strengths are aimed at the tumor from many angles this type of radiation therapy is less likely to cause dry mouth trouble swallowing and damage to the skin                  internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary    radiation therapy to the neck may change the way the thyroid gland works blood tests may be done to check the thyroid hormone level in the body before treatment and at regular checkups after treatment
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website     chemotherapy     chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy        hyperfractionated radiation therapy     hyperfractionated radiation therapy is a type of external radiation treatment in which a smaller than usual total daily dose of radiation is divided into two doses and the treatments are given twice a day hyperfractionated radiation therapy is given over the same period of time days or weeks as standard radiation therapy
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to grnrelated frontotemporal dementia ,grnrelated frontotemporal dementia results from mutations in the grn gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein called granulin also known as progranulin granulin is active in many different tissues in the body where it helps control the growth division and survival of cells granulins function in the brain is not well understood although it appears to play an important role in the survival of nerve cells neurons  most mutations in the grn gene prevent any granulin from being produced from one copy of the gene in each cell as a result cells make only half the usual amount of granulin it is unclear how a shortage of this protein leads to the features of grnrelated frontotemporal dementia however studies have shown that the disorder is characterized by the buildup of a protein called tar dnabinding protein  in certain brain cells the  protein forms clumps aggregates that may interfere with cell functions and ultimately lead to cell death researchers are working to determine how mutations in the grn gene and the resulting loss of granulin are related to a buildup of  in the brain  the features of grnrelated frontotemporal dementia result from the gradual loss of neurons in regions near the front of the brain called the frontal and temporal lobes the frontal lobes are involved in reasoning planning judgment and problemsolving while the temporal lobes help process hearing speech memory and emotion the death of neurons in these areas causes problems with many critical brain functions however it is unclear why the loss of neurons occurs in the frontal and temporal lobes more often than other brain regions in people with grnrelated frontotemporal dementia
information,what is are cherubism ,cherubism is a disorder characterized by abnormal bone tissue in the lower part of the face beginning in early childhood both the lower jaw the mandible and the upper jaw the maxilla become enlarged as bone is replaced with painless cystlike growths these growths give the cheeks a swollen rounded appearance and often interfere with normal tooth development in some people the condition is so mild that it may not be noticeable while other cases are severe enough to cause problems with vision breathing speech and swallowing enlargement of the jaw usually continues throughout childhood and stabilizes during puberty the abnormal growths are gradually replaced with normal bone in early adulthood as a result many affected adults have a normal facial appearance  most people with cherubism have few if any signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body rarely however this condition occurs as part of another genetic disorder for example cherubism can occur with ramon syndrome which also involves short stature intellectual disability and overgrowth of the gums gingival fibrosis additionally cherubism has been reported in rare cases of noonan syndrome a developmental disorder characterized by unusual facial characteristics short stature and heart defects and fragile x syndrome a condition primarily affecting males that causes learning disabilities and cognitive impairment

causes,what causes wolfram syndrome ,what causes wolfram syndrome there are two types of wolfram syndrome type  and type  which are primarily differentiated by their genetic cause changes mutations in the  gene are responsible for approximately  of wolfram syndrome type  cases this gene encodes wolframin a protein that is important for the proper functioning of the endoplasmic reticulum the part of a cell that is involved in protein production processing and transport wolframin helps regulate the amount of calcium in cells which is important for many different cellular functions mutations in  result in a defective form of wolframin that is unable to perform its normal role this causes cells to trigger their own death apoptosis the death of cells in various organs and other parts of the body results in the signs and symptoms of wolfram syndrome type  a specific mutation in the  gene causes wolfram syndrome type  although the exact function of this gene is not known scientists suspect that it plays an important role in the mitochondria the part of the cell where energy is produced mutations in  lead to the loss of mitochondria which decreases the amount of energy available to cells cells that do not have enough energy die as in wolfram syndrome type  the death of cells in different parts of the body results in the many health problems associated with wolfram syndrome type  mutations in mitochondrial dna may also be a rare cause of wolfram syndrome in some families
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to coats plus syndrome ,coats plus syndrome results from mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in structures known as telomeres which are found at the ends of chromosomes telomeres are short repetitive segments of dna that help protect chromosomes from abnormally sticking together or breaking down degrading in most cells telomeres become progressively shorter as the cell divides after a certain number of cell divisions the telomeres become so short that they trigger the cell to stop dividing or to selfdestruct undergo apoptosis the  protein works as part of a group of proteins known as the cst complex which is involved in the copying replication of telomeres the cst complex helps prevent telomeres from being degraded in some cells as the cells divide  mutations in the  gene impair the function of the cst complex which affects the replication of telomeres however it is unclear how  gene mutations impact telomere structure and function some studies have found that people with  gene mutations have abnormally short telomeres while other studies have found no change in telomere length researchers are working to determine how telomeres are different in people with  gene mutations and how these changes could underlie the varied signs and symptoms of coats plus syndrome

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to phenylketonuria ,mutations in the pah gene cause phenylketonuria  the pah gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase this enzyme converts the amino acid phenylalanine to other important compounds in the body if gene mutations reduce the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase phenylalanine from the diet is not processed effectively as a result this amino acid can build up to toxic levels in the blood and other tissues because nerve cells in the brain are particularly sensitive to phenylalanine levels excessive amounts of this substance can cause brain damage  classic pku the most severe form of the disorder occurs when phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is severely reduced or absent people with untreated classic pku have levels of phenylalanine high enough to cause severe brain damage and other serious medical problems mutations in the pah gene that allow the enzyme to retain some activity result in milder versions of this condition such as variant pku or nonpku hyperphenylalaninemia  changes in other genes may influence the severity of pku but little is known about these additional genetic factors
exams and tests,how to diagnose anxiety disorders ,anxiety disorders sometimes run in families but no one knows for sure why some people have them while others dont anxiety disorders are more common among younger adults than older adults and they typically start in early life however anyone can develop an anxiety disorder at any time below are risk factors for these anxiety disorders  generalized anxiety disorder gad    social anxiety disorder social phobia   panic disorder generalized anxiety disorder gad social anxiety disorder social phobia panic disorder generalized anxiety disorder  risk factors generalized anxiety disorder gad affects about  million american adults including twice as many women as men the disorder develops gradually and can begin at any point in the life cycle although the years of highest risk are between childhood and middle age the average age of onset is  years old social phobia  risk factors social phobia affects about  million american adults women and men are equally likely to develop the disorder which usually begins in childhood or early adolescence there is some evidence that genetic factors are involved panic disorder  risk factors panic disorder affects about  million american adults and is twice as common in women as men panic attacks often begin in late adolescence or early adulthood but not everyone who experiences panic attacks will develop panic disorder many people have just one attack and never have another the tendency to develop panic attacks appears to be inherited diagnosis can be difficult there are a number of reasons why it can be difficult to accurately diagnose an anxiety disorder in older adults  anxiety disorders among older adults frequently occur at the same time as other illnesses such as depression diabetes heart disease or a number of other medical illnesses problems with cognition thinking and changes in life circumstances can also complicate matters sometimes the physical signs of these illnesses can get mixed up with the symptoms of anxiety making it difficult to determine if a person has a true anxiety disorder for instance a person with heart disease sometimes has chest pain which can also be a symptom of a panic disorder  anxiety disorders among older adults frequently occur at the same time as other illnesses such as depression diabetes heart disease or a number of other medical illnesses problems with cognition thinking and changes in life circumstances can also complicate matters sometimes the physical signs of these illnesses can get mixed up with the symptoms of anxiety making it difficult to determine if a person has a true anxiety disorder for instance a person with heart disease sometimes has chest pain which can also be a symptom of a panic disorder   doctors can have difficulty distinguishing between anxiety caused by adapting to difficult life changes and a true anxiety disorder for example if you fell and broke a hip you may be justifiably fearful of going out for a while but that would not mean you have developed an anxiety disorder doctors can have difficulty distinguishing between anxiety caused by adapting to difficult life changes and a true anxiety disorder for example if you fell and broke a hip you may be justifiably fearful of going out for a while but that would not mean you have developed an anxiety disorder  sometimes the worrying symptoms of a medical illness can lead to an anxiety disorder or sometimes the side effects of medication can cause anxiety also a disability or a change in lifestyle caused by a medical illness may lead to an anxiety disorder muscle tightness feeling very tense all the time and difficulty sleeping can also be symptoms of a physical illness or an anxiety disorder complicating diagnosis sometimes the worrying symptoms of a medical illness can lead to an anxiety disorder or sometimes the side effects of medication can cause anxiety also a disability or a change in lifestyle caused by a medical illness may lead to an anxiety disorder muscle tightness feeling very tense all the time and difficulty sleeping can also be symptoms of a physical illness or an anxiety disorder complicating diagnosis diagnosis here is how these anxiety disorders are diagnosed  generalized anxiety disorder gad   panic disorder   social anxiety disorder social phobia generalized anxiety disorder gad panic disorder social anxiety disorder social phobia generalized anxiety disorder gad  diagnosis gad can be diagnosed once a person worries excessively about a variety of everyday problems for at least  months people with gad may visit a doctor many times before they find out they have this disorder they ask their doctors to help them with headaches or trouble falling asleep which can be symptoms of gad but they dont always get the help they need right away it may take doctors some time to be sure that a person has gad instead of something else social phobia  diagnosis a doctor can tell that a person has social phobia if the person has had symptoms for at least  months social phobia usually starts during youth without treatment it can last for many years or a lifetime panic disorder  diagnosis people with panic disorder may sometimes go from doctor to doctor for years and visit the emergency room repeatedly before someone correctly diagnoses their condition this is unfortunate because panic disorder is one of the most treatable of all the anxiety disorders responding in most cases to certain kinds of medication or certain kinds of cognitive psychotherapy which help change thinking patterns that lead to fear and anxiety if you have symptoms anxiety disorders are treatable if you think you have an anxiety disorder talk to your family doctor your doctor should do an exam to make sure that another physical problem isnt causing the symptoms the doctor may refer you to a mental health specialist you should feel comfortable talking with the mental health specialist you choose if you do not seek help elsewhere once you find a mental health specialist you are comfortable with you should work as a team and make a plan to treat your anxiety disorder together talk about about past treatment people with anxiety disorders who have already received treatment for an anxiety disorder should tell their doctor about that treatment in detail if they received medication they should tell their doctor what medication was used what the dosage was at the beginning of treatment whether the dosage was increased or decreased while they were under treatment what side effects may have occurred and whether the treatment helped them become less anxious if they received psychotherapy they should describe the type of therapy how often they attended sessions and whether the therapy was useful

stages,what are the stages of testicular cancer ,"key points
                     after testicular cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body      there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body     cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body     the following stages are used for testicular cancer          stage  testicular intraepithelial neoplasia      stage i      stage ii      stage iii
                
                
                    after testicular cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body
                    the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment    the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process            chest xray  an xray of the organs and bones inside the chest an xray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film making a picture of areas inside the body       ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography       pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do        mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri       abdominal lymph node dissection  a surgical procedure in which lymph nodes in the abdomen are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer this procedure is also called lymphadenectomy for patients with nonseminoma removing the lymph nodes may help stop the spread of disease cancer cells in the lymph nodes of seminoma patients can be treated with radiation therapy        serum tumor marker test  a procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs tissues or tumor cells in the body certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood these are called tumor markers the following  tumor markers are used in staging testicular cancer                 alphafetoprotein afp        betahuman chorionic gonadotropin hcg         lactate dehydrogenase ldh         tumor marker levels are measured again after inguinal orchiectomy and biopsy in order to determine the stage of the cancer this helps to show if all of the cancer has been removed or if more treatment is needed tumor marker levels are also measured during followup as a way of checking if the cancer has come back
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body
                    cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood          tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas      lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body      blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body
                
                
                    cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body
                    when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood          lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body     blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body        the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if testicular cancer spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually testicular cancer cells the disease is metastatic testicular cancer not lung cancer
                
                
                    the following stages are used for testicular cancer
                    stage  testicular intraepithelial neoplasia    in stage  abnormal cells are found in the tiny tubules where the sperm cells begin to develop these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue all tumor marker levels are normal stage  is also called testicular intraepithelial neoplasia and testicular intratubular germ cell neoplasia        stage i    in stage i cancer has formed stage i is divided into stage ia stage ib and stage is and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done             in stage ia cancer is in the testicle and epididymis and may have spread to the inner layer of the membrane surrounding the testicle all tumor marker levels are normal      in stage ib cancer                     is in the testicle and the epididymis and has spread to the blood vessels or lymph vessels in the testicle or        has spread to the outer layer of the membrane surrounding the testicle or        is in the spermatic cord or the scrotum and may be in the blood vessels or lymph vessels of the testicle           all tumor marker levels are normal      in stage is cancer is found anywhere within the testicle spermatic cord or the scrotum and either                   all tumor marker levels are slightly above normal or        one or more tumor marker levels are moderately above normal or high                          stage ii     stage ii is divided into stage iia stage iib and stage iic and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done             in stage iia cancer                    is anywhere within the testicle spermatic cord or scrotum and        has spread to up to  lymph nodes in the abdomen none larger than  centimeters           all tumor marker levels are normal or slightly above normal      in stage iib cancer is anywhere within the testicle spermatic cord or scrotum and either                   has spread to up to  lymph nodes in the abdomen at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than  centimeters but none are larger than  centimeters or        has spread to more than  lymph nodes the lymph nodes are not larger than  centimeters           all tumor marker levels are normal or slightly above normal      in stage iic cancer                   is anywhere within the testicle spermatic cord or scrotum and        has spread to a lymph node in the abdomen that is larger than  centimeters           all tumor marker levels are normal or slightly above normal              stage iii     stage iii is divided into stage iiia stage iiib and stage iiic and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done             in stage iiia cancer                   is anywhere within the testicle spermatic cord or scrotum and        may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen and        has spread to distant lymph nodes or to the lungs            tumor marker levels may range from normal to slightly above normal      in stage iiib cancer                   is anywhere within the testicle spermatic cord or scrotum and        may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen to distant lymph nodes or to the lungs           the level of one or more tumor markers is moderately above normal      in stage iiic cancer                   is anywhere within the testicle spermatic cord or scrotum and        may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen to distant lymph nodes or to the lungs            the level of one or more tumor markers is high or cancer                   is anywhere within the testicle spermatic cord or scrotum and        may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen and        has not spread to distant lymph nodes or the lung but has spread to other parts of the body           tumor marker levels may range from normal to high"

exams and tests,how to diagnose childhood central nervous system atypical teratoidrhabdoid tumor ,"tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect find cns atypical teratoidrhabdoid tumor the following tests and procedures may be used            physical exam and history  an exam of the body to check general signs of health including checking for signs of disease such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken       neurological exam  a series of questions and tests to check the brain spinal cord and nerve function the exam checks a persons mental status coordination and ability to walk normally and how well the muscles senses and reflexes work this may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam        mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri       lumbar puncture  a procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid csf from the spinal column this is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the csf around the spinal cord and removing a sample of fluid the sample of csf is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells the sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose a higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor this procedure is also called an lp or spinal tap        and  gene testing a laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for the  and  genes
                    childhood atypical teratoidrhabdoid tumor is diagnosed and may be removed in surgery if doctors think there might be a brain tumor a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue for tumors in the brain the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells if cancer cells are found the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery the pathologist checks the cancer cells to find out the type of brain tumor it is often difficult to completely remove atrt because of where the tumor is in the brain and because it may already have spread at the time of diagnosis      the following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed            immunohistochemistry  a test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue the antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope this test is used to tell the difference between atrt and other brain tumors"

considerations,what to do for kidney failure choosing a treatment thats right for you ,"all of the treatment options for kidney failure require changes and restrictions in your diet
                
hemodialysis
                
hemodialysis has the most restrictions you should watch how much water and other liquids you get from food and drinks and avoid getting too much sodium often from salt potassium and phosphorus you may find it difficult to limit phosphorus because many foods that are high in phosphorus also provide the protein you need hemodialysis can remove protein from the body so you should eat foods with highquality protein such as meat fish and eggs limit your phosphorus by avoiding foods such as beans peas nuts tea and colas you may also need to take a pill called a phosphate binder that keeps phosphorus in your food from entering your bloodstream talk with your dialysis centers dietitian to find a hemodialysis meal plan that works for you
                
more information about nutrition for people who are on hemodialysis is provided in the niddk health topic eat right to feel right on hemodialysis
                
peritoneal dialysis
                
like hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis requires limits on sodium and phosphorus you may need to take a phosphate binder the liquid limitations in peritoneal dialysis may not be as strict as those for hemodialysis in fact you may need to drink more water and other liquids if your peritoneal dialysis treatments remove too much fluid from your body peritoneal dialysis removes potassium from the body so you may need to eat potassiumrich foods such as potatoes tomatoes oranges and bananas however be careful not to eat too much potassium because it can cause an unsteady heartbeat peritoneal dialysis removes even more protein than hemodialysis so eating foods with highquality protein is important you may need to limit calories because your body absorbs sugar from the dialysis solution
                
kidney transplantation
                
kidney transplantation has the fewest restrictions on your diet you should limit sodium because it can raise your blood pressure medicines that you take after the transplant can cause you to gain weight so you may need to limit calories
                
conservative management
                
the diet for conservative management limits protein protein breaks down into waste products the kidneys must remove limiting protein may reduce the amount of work the kidneys have to do so they will last longer

information,what is are primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia ,primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia pmah is a disorder characterized by multiple lumps nodules in the adrenal glands which are small hormoneproducing glands located on top of each kidney these nodules which usually are found in both adrenal glands bilateral and vary in size cause adrenal gland enlargement hyperplasia and result in the production of higherthannormal levels of the hormone cortisol cortisol is an important hormone that suppresses inflammation and protects the body from physical stress such as infection or trauma through several mechanisms including raising blood sugar levels  pmah typically becomes evident in a persons forties or fifties it is considered a form of cushing syndrome which is characterized by increased levels of cortisol resulting from one of many possible causes these increased cortisol levels lead to weight gain in the face and upper body fragile skin bone loss fatigue and other health problems however some people with pmah do not experience these signs and symptoms and are said to have subclinical cushing syndrome
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to steatocystoma multiplex ,steatocystoma multiplex can be caused by mutations in the  gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin  which is produced in the nails the hair follicles and the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet it is also found in the skins sebaceous glands keratin  partners with a similar protein called keratin  to form networks that provide strength and resilience to the skin nails and other tissues  the  gene mutations that cause steatocystoma multiplex alter the structure of keratin  preventing it from forming strong stable networks within cells the defective keratin network disrupts the growth and function of cells in the skin and nails including cells that make up the sebaceous glands these abnormalities lead to the growth of sebumcontaining cysts in people with steatocystoma multiplex however it is unclear why steatocystomas are typically the only feature of this disorder  many researchers believe that steatocystoma multiplex is a variant form of a disorder called pachyonychia congenita which can also result from mutations in the  gene like steatocystoma multiplex pachyonychia congenita involves the growth of steatocystomas pachyonychia congenita is also associated with more severe skin and nail abnormalities not usually found in people with steatocystoma multiplex  in some cases people with steatocystoma multiplex do not have an identified mutation in the  gene the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown
information,what is are hartnup disease ,hartnup disease is a metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal transport of certain amino acids in the kidney and gastrointestinal system it is a type of aminoaciduria the condition may be diagnosed based on the results of newborn screening tests most people with the condition have no symptoms asymptomatic for those who do show symptoms the onset of the disease is usually between the ages of  and  occasionally the disease may present in adulthood mental development is usually normal though a few cases with intellectual impairment have been reported the signs and symptoms of hartnup disease incude skin photosensitivity neurologic findings psychiatric symptoms and ocular eye findings hartnup disease is caused by mutations in the  gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner people with hartnup disease may benefit from a highprotein diet protection from sunlight vitamin supplementation and avoidance of certain drugsmedications in some cases treatment with nicotinamide supplements and tryptophan ethyl ester may be indicated
information,what is are taskspecific focal dystonia ,taskspecific focal dystonia is a movement disorder that interferes with the performance of particular tasks such as writing playing a musical instrument or participating in a sport dystonias are a group of movement problems characterized by involuntary sustained muscle contractions tremors and other uncontrolled movements the term focal refers to a type of dystonia that affects a single part of the body such as the hand or jaw  researchers have described several forms of taskspecific focal dystonia the most common is writers cramp in which muscle cramps or spasms in the hand wrist or forearm interfere with holding a pen or pencil writers cramp begins in the hand used for writing the dominant hand and is usually limited to that task but with time it can spread to the other hand and affect other finemotor activities such as shaving or typing  musicians dystonia is a form of taskspecific focal dystonia characterized by muscle cramps and spasms that occur while playing a musical instrument this condition can affect amateur or professional musicians and the location of the dystonia depends on the instrument some musicians such as piano guitar and violin players develop focal hand dystonia which causes loss of finemotor control in the hand and wrist muscles this condition reduces finger coordination speed and endurance while playing musicians who play woodwind or brass instruments can develop what is known as embouchure dystonia this condition causes muscle cramps or spasms involving the lips tongue or jaw which prevents normal positioning of the mouth around the instruments mouthpiece musicians dystonia often occurs only when playing a particular instrument however over time focal hand dystonia may impair other activities and embouchure dystonia can worsen to affect eating and speech  taskspecific focal dystonia can affect people who play sports and engage in other occupations involving repetitive highly practiced movements for example some golfers experience involuntary jerking of the wrists during putting a condition known informally as the yips cramps and spasms of the hand and arm muscles can also affect tennis players billiards players dart throwers and other athletes additionally taskspecific dystonia has been reported in tailors shoemakers hair stylists and people who frequently type or use a computer mouse  the abnormal movements associated with taskspecific focal dystonia are usually painless although they can cause anxiety when they interfere with musical performance and other activities severe cases can cause professional disability
prevention,how to prevent creating a family health history ,people cant change the genes they inherit from their parents but they can change other things to prevent diseases that run in the family this is good news because many diseases result from a combination of a persons genes lifestyle and environment actions to reduce the risk of disease may involve lifestyle changes such as eating healthier foods exercising more getting certain medical tests and taking medicines that are more effective based on your specific genes ask your doctor or health care professional for advice
inheritance,is familial adenomatous polyposis inherited ,familial adenomatous polyposis can have different inheritance patterns  when familial adenomatous polyposis results from mutations in the apc gene it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder in most cases an affected person has one parent with the condition  when familial adenomatous polyposis results from mutations in the mutyh gene it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations most often the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to type a insulin resistance syndrome ,type a insulin resistance syndrome results from mutations in the insr gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein called an insulin receptor which is found in many types of cells insulin receptors are embedded in the outer membrane surrounding the cell where they attach bind to insulin circulating in the bloodstream this binding triggers signaling pathways that influence many cell functions  most of the insr gene mutations that cause type a insulin resistance syndrome lead to the production of a faulty insulin receptor that cannot transmit signals properly although insulin is present in the bloodstream the defective receptors make it less able to exert its effects on cells and tissues this severe resistance to the effects of insulin impairs blood sugar regulation and leads to diabetes mellitus in females with type a insulin resistance syndrome excess insulin in the bloodstream interacts with hormonal factors during adolescence to cause abnormalities of the menstrual cycle ovarian cysts and other features of the disorder  this condition is designated as type a to distinguish it from type b insulin resistance syndrome although the two disorders have similar signs and symptoms type b is not caused by insr gene mutations instead it results from an abnormality of the immune system that blocks insulin receptor function

symptoms,what are the symptoms of hemorrhoids ,"the most common symptom of internal hemorrhoids is bright red blood on stool on toilet paper or in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement internal hemorrhoids that are not prolapsed are usually not painful prolapsed hemorrhoids often cause pain discomfort and anal itching
                
blood clots may form in external hemorrhoids a blood clot in a vein is called a thrombosis thrombosed external hemorrhoids cause bleeding painful swelling or a hard lump around the anus when the blood clot dissolves extra skin is left behind this skin can become irritated or itch
                
excessive straining rubbing or cleaning around the anus may make symptoms such as itching and irritation worse
                
hemorrhoids are not dangerous or life threatening symptoms usually go away within a few days and some people with hemorrhoids never have symptoms"

exams and tests,how to diagnose rh incompatibility ,"rh incompatibility is diagnosed with blood tests to find out whether a baby is developing hemolytic anemia and how serious it is doctors may use more advanced tests such as ultrasound
                
specialists involved
                
an obstetrician will screen for rh incompatibility this is a doctor who specializes in treating pregnant women the obstetrician also will monitor the pregnancy and the baby for problems related to hemolytic anemia he or she also will oversee treatment to prevent problems with future pregnancies
                
a pediatrician or hematologist treats newborns who have hemolytic anemia and related problems a pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in treating children a hematologist is a doctor who specializes in treating people who have blood diseases and disorders
                
diagnostic tests
                
if youre pregnant your doctor will order a simple blood test at your first prenatal visit to learn whether youre rhpositive or rhnegative
                
if youre rhnegative you also may have another blood test called an antibody screen this test shows whether you have rh antibodies in your blood if you do it means that you were exposed to rhpositive blood before and youre at risk for rh incompatibility
                
if youre rhnegative and you dont have rh antibodies your babys father also will be tested to find out his rh type if hes rhnegative too the baby has no chance of having rhpositive blood thus theres no risk of rh incompatibility
                
however if the babys father is rhpositive the baby has a  percent or more chance of having rhpositive blood as a result youre at high risk of developing rhincompatibility
                
if your babys father is rhpositive or if its not possible to find out his rh status your doctor may do a test called amniocentesis
                
for this test your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus he or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby the fluid is tested to learn whether the baby is rhpositive rarely an amniocentesis can expose you to rhpositive blood
                
your doctor also may use this test to measure bilirubin levels in your baby bilirubin builds up as a result of red blood cells dying too quickly the higher the level of bilirubin is the greater the chance that the baby has hemolytic anemia
                
if rh incompatibility is known or suspected youll be tested for rh antibodies one or more times during your pregnancy this test often is done at least once at your sixth or seventh month of pregnancy
                
the results from this test also can suggest how severe the babys hemolytic anemia has become higher levels of antibodies suggest more severe hemolytic anemia
                
to check your baby for hemolytic anemia your doctor also may use a test called doppler ultrasound he or she will use this test to measure how fast blood is flowing through an artery in the babys head
                
doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to measure how fast blood is moving the faster the blood flow is the greater the risk of hemolytic anemia this is because the anemia will cause the babys heart to pump more blood"

information,what is are dry eye ,poor tear production dry eye occurs when the eye does not produce tears properly or when the tears are of poor quality and dry up quickly the eyes need tears for overall eye health and clear vision dry eye can last a short time or it can be an ongoing condition it can include a variety of symptoms such as discomfort and pain your eyes may sting and burn and you may have redness and a sandy or gritty feeling as if something is in your eye you may have blurry vision and your eyes may feel tired having dry eyes can make it harder to do some activities such as using a computer or reading for a long period of time and it can make it hard to be in dry places such as on an airplane  tears and eye health tears are necessary for overall eye health and clear vision the eye constantly makes tears to bathe nourish and protect the cornea the cornea is the clear domeshaped outer surface that covers the eye in front of the iris which is the colored part of the eye the eye also makes tears in response to emergencies such as a particle of dust in the eye an infection or irritation of the eye or an onset of strong emotions tears keep the eye moist and wash away dust and debris they also help protect the eye from infections tears are made of proteins including growth factors body salts and vitamins that maintain the health of the eye surface and prevent infection  tear components tears have three major components  an outer oily fat layer produced by the meibomian glands located in the eyelids   a middle watery layer produced by the lacrimal glands located just above the upper outer corner of the eye   an inner mucous layer produced by goblet cells located within a thin clear layer which covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids called the conjunctiva an outer oily fat layer produced by the meibomian glands located in the eyelids a middle watery layer produced by the lacrimal glands located just above the upper outer corner of the eye an inner mucous layer produced by goblet cells located within a thin clear layer which covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids called the conjunctiva when the lacrimal glands do not make enough tears dry eye can result any disease process that changes the components of tears can make them unhealthy and result in dry eye type of dry eye there are two types of dry eye aqueous teardeficient dry eye and evaporative dry eye aqueous teardeficient dry eye is a disorder in which the tear glands do not produce enough of the watery component of tears to maintain a healthy cornea evaporative dry eye may result from inflammation of the meibomian glands located in the eyelids these glands make the oily part of tears that slows evaporation and keeps the tears stable most people with dry eye will not have serious problems but severe dry eye may lead to inflammation ulcers or scars on the cornea and some loss of vision permanent loss of vision from dry eye is uncommon
inheritance,is lateinfantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition
information,what is are netherton syndrome ,netherton syndrome is a disorder that affects the skin hair and immune system newborns with netherton syndrome have skin that is red and scaly ichthyosiform erythroderma and the skin may leak fluid some affected infants are born with a tight clear sheath covering their skin called a collodion membrane this membrane is usually shed during the first few weeks of life because newborns with this disorder are missing the protection provided by normal skin they are at risk of becoming dehydrated and developing infections in the skin or throughout the body sepsis which can be lifethreatening affected babies may also fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate failure to thrive the health of older children and adults with netherton syndrome usually improves although they often remain underweight and of short stature  after infancy the severity of the skin abnormalities varies among people with netherton syndrome and can fluctuate over time the skin may continue to be red and scaly especially during the first few years of life some affected individuals have intermittent redness or experience outbreaks of a distinctive skin abnormality called ichthyosis linearis circumflexa involving patches of multiple ringlike lesions the triggers for the outbreaks are not known but researchers suggest that stress or infections may be involved  itchiness is a common problem for affected individuals and scratching can lead to frequent infections dead skin cells are shed at an abnormal rate and often accumulate in the ear canals which can affect hearing if not removed regularly the skin is abnormally absorbent of substances such as lotions and ointments which can result in excessive blood levels of some topical medications because the ability of the skin to protect against heat and cold is impaired affected individuals may have difficulty regulating their body temperature  people with netherton syndrome have hair that is fragile and breaks easily some strands of hair vary in diameter with thicker and thinner spots this feature is known as bamboo hair trichorrhexis nodosa or trichorrhexis invaginata in addition to the hair on the scalp the eyelashes and eyebrows may be affected the hair abnormality in netherton syndrome may not be noticed in infancy because babies often have sparse hair  most people with netherton syndrome have immune systemrelated problems such as food allergies hay fever asthma or an inflammatory skin disorder called eczema
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to neurofibromatosis type  ,mutations in the  gene cause neurofibromatosis type   the  gene provides instructions for making a protein called neurofibromin this protein is produced in many cells including nerve cells and specialized cells surrounding nerves oligodendrocytes and schwann cells neurofibromin acts as a tumor suppressor which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way mutations in the  gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of neurofibromin that cannot regulate cell growth and division as a result tumors such as neurofibromas can form along nerves throughout the body it is unclear how mutations in the  gene lead to the other features of neurofibromatosis type  such as cafaulait spots and learning disabilities
causes,what causes mowatwilson syndrome ,what causes mowatwilson syndrome mowatwilson syndrome is caused by mutations in the  also known as  or  gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of many organs and tissues before birth it is a transcription factor which means that it attaches binds to specific regions of dna and helps control the activity of particular genes researchers believe that  protein is involved in the development of tissues that give rise to the nervous system digestive tract facial features heart and other organs mowatwilson syndrome almost always results from the loss of one working copy of the  gene in each cell in some cases the entire gene is deleted in other cases mutations within the gene lead to the production of an abnormally short nonfunctional version of the  protein a shortage of this protein disrupts the normal development of many organs and tissues which causes the varied signs and symptoms of mowatwilson syndrome
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to coffinlowry syndrome ,mutations in the  gene cause coffinlowry syndrome this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in signaling within cells researchers believe that this protein helps control the activity of other genes and plays an important role in the brain the protein is involved in cell signaling pathways that are required for learning the formation of longterm memories and the survival of nerve cells gene mutations result in the production of little or no  protein but it is unclear how a lack of this protein causes the signs and symptoms of coffinlowry syndrome  some people with the features of coffinlowry syndrome do not have identified mutations in the  gene in these cases the cause of the condition is unknown

information,what is are ohtahara syndrome ,ohtahara syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by seizures the disorder affects newborns usually within the first three months of life most often within the first  days in the form of epileptic seizures infants have primarily tonic seizures but may also experience partial seizures and rarely myoclonic seizures ohtahara syndrome is most commonly caused by metabolic disorders or structural damage in the brain although the cause or causes for many cases cant be determined most infants with the disorder show significant underdevelopment of part or all of the cerebral hemispheres the eegs of infants with ohtahara syndrome reveal a characteristic pattern of high voltage spike wave discharge followed by little activity this pattern is known as burst suppression doctors have observed that boys are more often affected than girls
inheritance,is boomerang dysplasia inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder almost all cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family
information,what is are phaeohyphomycosis ,phaeohyphomycosis refers to fungal infections caused by dematiaceous darkly pigmented fungi it can be associated with a variety of clinical syndromes including invasive sinusitis nodules or abscesses beneath the skin keratitis lung masses osteomyelitis mycotic arthritis endocarditis brain abscess and widespread infection although the condition can affect all people it is most commonly diagnosed in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed people and can even be lifethreatening in these populations treatment depends on the signs and symptoms present in each person but may include surgery andor various medications
information,what is are electrocardiogram ,"an electrocardiogram elektrokardeogram also called an ekg or ecg is a simple painless test that records the hearts electrical activity to understand this test it helps to understand how the heart works
                
with each heartbeat an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom as it travels the signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood the process repeats with each new heartbeat
                
the hearts electrical signals set the rhythm of the heartbeat for more detailed information and animations go to the health topics how the heart works article
                
an ekg shows
                
how fast your heart is beating
                
whether the rhythm of your heartbeat is steady or irregular
                
the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of your heart
                
doctors use ekgs to detect and study many heart problems such as heart attacks arrhythmias ahrithmeahs and heart failure the tests results also can suggest other disorders that affect heart function"
treatment,what are the treatments for kidney dysplasia ,"if the condition is limited to one kidney and the baby has no signs of kidney dysplasia no treatment may be necessary however the baby should have regular checkups that include
                
 checking blood pressure   testing blood to measure kidney function   testing urine for albumin a protein most often found in blood albumin in the urine may be a sign of kidney damage   performing periodic ultrasounds to monitor the damaged kidney and to make sure the functioning kidney continues to grow and remains healthy"
information,what is are campylobacter infections ,campylobacter infection is a common foodborne illness you get it from eating raw or undercooked poultry you can also get it from coming in contact with contaminated packages of poultry symptoms include         diarrhea     cramping     abdominal pain     fever      nausea and vomiting       some infected people dont have any symptoms the illness usually lasts one week most people get better without treatment you should drink extra fluids for as long as the diarrhea lasts your doctor will decide whether you need to take antibiotics     to prevent campylobacter infection cook poultry thoroughly use a separate cutting board and utensils for meats and clean them carefully with soap and hot water after use    centers for disease control and prevention
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to noonan syndrome ,mutations in the    kras nras and braf genes cause noonan syndrome  most cases of noonan syndrome result from mutations in one of three genes   or   gene mutations account for approximately  percent of all cases of noonan syndrome  gene mutations account for  to  percent and  gene mutations account for  to  percent of noonan syndrome cases about  percent of people with noonan syndrome have mutations in the kras gene and usually have a more severe or atypical form of the disorder it is not known how many cases are caused by mutations in the braf or nras genes but it is likely a very small proportion the cause of noonan syndrome in the remaining  percent of people with this disorder is unknown  the    kras nras and braf genes all provide instructions for making proteins that are important in signaling pathways needed for the proper formation of several types of tissue during development these proteins also play roles in cell division cell movement and cell differentiation the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions mutations in any of the genes listed above cause the resulting protein to be continuously active rather than switching on and off in response to cell signals this constant activation disrupts the regulation of systems that control cell growth and division leading to the characteristic features of noonan syndrome
treatment,what are the treatments for asthma ,"asthma is a longterm disease that has no cure the goal of asthma treatment is to control the disease good asthma control will
                
prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath

help you maintain good lung function
                
let you maintain your normal activity level and sleep through the night
                
prevent asthma attacks that could result in an emergency room visit or hospital stay
                
to control asthma partner with your doctor to manage your asthma or your childs asthma children aged  or olderand younger children who are ableshould take an active role in their asthma care
                
taking an active role to control your asthma involves
                
working with your doctor to treat other conditions that can interfere with asthma management
                
avoiding things that worsen your asthma asthma triggers however one trigger you should not avoid is physical activity physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active
                
working with your doctor and other health care providers to create and follow an asthma action plan
                
an asthma action plan gives guidance on taking your medicines properly avoiding asthma triggers except physical activity tracking your level of asthma control responding to worsening symptoms and seeking emergency care when needed
                
asthma is treated with two types of medicines longterm control and quickrelief medicines longterm control medicines help reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms quickrelief or rescue medicines relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up
                
your initial treatment will depend on the severity of your asthma followup asthma treatment will depend on how well your asthma action plan is controlling your symptoms and preventing asthma attacks
                
your level of asthma control can vary over time and with changes in your home school or work environments these changes can alter how often youre exposed to the factors that can worsen your asthma
                
your doctor may need to increase your medicine if your asthma doesnt stay under control on the other hand if your asthma is well controlled for several months your doctor may decrease your medicine these adjustments to your medicine will help you maintain the best control possible with the least amount of medicine necessary
                
asthma treatment for certain groups of peoplesuch as children pregnant women or those for whom exercise brings on asthma symptomswill be adjusted to meet their special needs

several health conditions can make asthma harder to manage these conditions include runny nose sinus infections reflux disease psychological stress and sleep apnea your doctor will treat these conditions as well
                
medicines
                
your doctor will consider many things when deciding which asthma medicines are best for you he or she will check to see how well a medicine works for you then he or she will adjust the dose or medicine as needed
                
asthma medicines can be taken in pill form but most are taken using a device called an inhaler an inhaler allows the medicine to go directly to your lungs
                
not all inhalers are used the same way ask your doctor or another health care provider to show you the right way to use your inhaler review the way you use your inhaler at every medical visit
                
longterm control medicines
                
most people who have asthma need to take longterm control medicines daily to help prevent symptoms the most effective longterm medicines reduce airway inflammation which helps prevent symptoms from starting these medicines dont give you quick relief from symptoms
                
inhaled corticosteroids inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred medicine for longterm control of asthma theyre the most effective option for longterm relief of the inflammation and swelling that makes your airways sensitive to certain inhaled substances
                
reducing inflammation helps prevent the chain reaction that causes asthma symptoms most people who take these medicines daily find they greatly reduce the severity of symptoms and how often they occur
                
inhaled corticosteroids generally are safe when taken as prescribed these medicines are different from the illegal anabolic steroids taken by some athletes inhaled corticosteroids arent habitforming even if you take them every day for many years
                
like many other medicines though inhaled corticosteroids can have side effects most doctors agree that the benefits of taking inhaled corticosteroids and preventing asthma attacks far outweigh the risk of side effects
                
one common side effect from inhaled corticosteroids is a mouth infection called thrush you might be able to use a spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler to avoid thrush these devices attach to your inhaler they help prevent the medicine from landing in your mouth or on the back of your throat
                
check with your doctor to see whether a spacer or holding chamber should be used with the inhaler you have also work with your health care team if you have any questions about how to use a spacer or holding chamber rinsing your mouth out with water after taking inhaled corticosteroids also can lower your risk for thrush
                
if you have severe asthma you may have to take corticosteroid pills or liquid for short periods to get your asthma under control
                
if taken for long periods these medicines raise your risk for cataracts and osteoporosis osteoporosis a cataract is the clouding of the lens in your eye osteoporosis is a disorder that makes your bones weak and more likely to break
                
your doctor may have you add another longterm asthma control medicine so he or she can lower your dose of corticosteroids or your doctor may suggest you take calcium and vitamin d pills to protect your bones
                
other longterm control medicines other longterm control medicines include
                
cromolyn this medicine is taken using a device called a nebulizer as you breathe in the nebulizer sends a fine mist of medicine to your lungs cromolyn helps prevent airway inflammation
                
omalizumab antiige this medicine is given as a shot injection one or two times a month it helps prevent your body from reacting to asthma triggers such as pollen and dust mites antiige might be used if other asthma medicines have not worked well
                
a rare but possibly lifethreatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis might occur when the omalizumab injection is given if you take this medication work with your doctor to make sure you understand the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and what actions you should take
                
inhaled longacting  these medicines open the airways they might be added to inhaled corticosteroids to improve asthma control inhaled longacting  should never be used on their own for longterm asthma control they must used with inhaled corticosteroids
                
leukotriene modifiers these medicines are taken by mouth they help block the chain reaction that increases inflammation in your airways
                
theophylline this medicine is taken by mouth theophylline helps open the airways
                
if your doctor prescribes a longterm control medicine take it every day to control your asthma your asthma symptoms will likely return or get worse if you stop taking your medicine
                
longterm control medicines can have side effects talk with your doctor about these side effects and ways to reduce or avoid them
                
with some medicines like theophylline your doctor will check the level of medicine in your blood this helps ensure that youre getting enough medicine to relieve your asthma symptoms but not so much that it causes dangerous side effects
                
quickrelief medicines
                
all people who have asthma need quickrelief medicines to help relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up inhaled shortacting  are the first choice for quick relief
                
these medicines act quickly to relax tight muscles around your airways when youre having a flareup this allows the airways to open up so air can flow through them
                
you should take your quickrelief medicine when you first notice asthma symptoms if you use this medicine more than  days a week talk with your doctor about your asthma control you may need to make changes to your asthma action plan
                
carry your quickrelief inhaler with you at all times in case you need it if your child has asthma make sure that anyone caring for him or her has the childs quickrelief medicines including staff at the childs school they should understand when and how to use these medicines and when to seek medical care for your child
                
you shouldnt use quickrelief medicines in place of prescribed longterm control medicines quickrelief medicines dont reduce inflammation
                
track your asthma
                
to track your asthma keep records of your symptoms check your peak flow number using a peak flow meter and get regular asthma checkups
                
record your symptoms
                
you can record your asthma symptoms in a diary to see how well your treatments are controlling your asthma
                
asthma is well controlled if
                
you have symptoms no more than  days a week and these symptoms dont wake you from sleep more than  or  nights a month
                
you can do all your normal activities
                
you take quickrelief medicines no more than  days a week
                
you have no more than one asthma attack a year that requires you to take corticosteroids by mouth
                
your peak flow doesnt drop below  percent of your personal best number
                
if your asthma isnt well controlled contact your doctor he or she may need to change your asthma action plan
                
use a peak flow meter
                
this small handheld device shows how well air moves out of your lungs you blow into the device and it gives you a score or peak flow number your score shows how well your lungs are working at the time of the test
                
your doctor will tell you how and when to use your peak flow meter he or she also will teach you how to take your medicines based on your score
                
your doctor and other health care providers may ask you to use your peak flow meter each morning and keep a record of your results you may find it very useful to record peak flow scores for a couple of weeks before each medical visit and take the results with you
                
when youre first diagnosed with asthma its important to find your personal best peak flow number to do this you record your score each day for a  to  period when your asthma is wellcontrolled the highest number you get during that time is your personal best you can compare this number to future numbers to make sure your asthma is controlled
                
your peak flow meter can help warn you of an asthma attack even before you notice symptoms if your score shows that your breathing is getting worse you should take your quickrelief medicines the way your asthma action plan directs then you can use the peak flow meter to check how well the medicine worked
                
get asthma checkups
                
when you first begin treatment youll see your doctor about every  to  weeks once your asthma is controlled your doctor may want to see you from once a month to twice a year
                
during these checkups your doctor may ask whether youve had an asthma attack since the last visit or any changes in symptoms or peak flow measurements he or she also may ask about your daily activities this information will help your doctor assess your level of asthma control
                
your doctor also may ask whether you have any problems or concerns with taking your medicines or following your asthma action plan based on your answers to these questions your doctor may change the dose of your medicine or give you a new medicine
                
if your control is very good you might be able to take less medicine the goal is to use the least amount of medicine needed to control your asthma
                
emergency care
                
most people who have asthma including many children can safely manage their symptoms by following their asthma action plans however you might need medical attention at times
                
call your doctor for advice if
                
your medicines dont relieve an asthma attack
                
your peak flow is less than half of your personal best peak flow number
                
call  for emergency care if
                
you have trouble walking and talking because youre out of breath
                
you have blue lips or fingernails
                
at the hospital youll be closely watched and given oxygen and more medicines as well as medicines at higher doses than you take at home such treatment can save your life
                
asthma treatment for special groups
                
the treatments described above generally apply to all people who have asthma however some aspects of treatment differ for people in certain age groups and those who have special needs
                
children
                
its hard to diagnose asthma in children younger than  years thus its hard to know whether young children who wheeze or have other asthma symptoms will benefit from longterm control medicines quickrelief medicines tend to relieve wheezing in young children whether they have asthma or not
                
doctors will treat infants and young children who have asthma symptoms with longterm control medicines if after assessing a child they feel that the symptoms are persistent and likely to continue after  years of age for more information go to how is asthma diagnosed
                
inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for young children montelukast and cromolyn are other options treatment might be given for a trial period of  to  weeks treatment usually is stopped if benefits arent seen during that time and the doctor and parents are confident the medicine was used properly
                
inhaled corticosteroids can possibly slow the growth of children of all ages slowed growth usually is apparent in the first several months of treatment is generally small and doesnt get worse over time poorly controlled asthma also may reduce a childs growth rate
                
many experts think the benefits of inhaled corticosteroids for children who need them to control their asthma far outweigh the risk of slowed growth
                
older adults
                
doctors may need to adjust asthma treatment for older adults who take certain other medicines such as beta blockers aspirin and other pain relievers and antiinflammatory medicines these medicines can prevent asthma medicines from working well and may worsen asthma symptoms
                
be sure to tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take including overthecounter medicines
                
older adults may develop weak bones from using inhaled corticosteroids especially at high doses talk with your doctor about taking calcium and vitamin d pills as well as other ways to help keep your bones strong
                
pregnant women
                
pregnant women who have asthma need to control the disease to ensure a good supply of oxygen to their babies poor asthma control increases the risk of preeclampsia a condition in which a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure and protein in the urine poor asthma control also increases the risk that a baby will be born early and have a low birth weight
                
studies show that its safer to take asthma medicines while pregnant than to risk having an asthma attack
                
talk with your doctor if you have asthma and are pregnant or planning a pregnancy your level of asthma control may get better or it may get worse while youre pregnant your health care team will check your asthma control often and adjust your treatment as needed
                
people whose asthma symptoms occur with physical activity
                
physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle adults need physical activity to maintain good health children need it for growth and development
                
in some people however physical activity can trigger asthma symptoms if this happens to you or your child talk with your doctor about the best ways to control asthma so you can stay active
                
the following medicines may help prevent asthma symptoms caused by physical activity
                
shortacting  quickrelief medicine taken shortly before physical activity can last  to  hours and prevent exerciserelated symptoms in most people who take them
                
longacting  can be protective for up to  hours however with daily use theyll no longer give up to  hours of protection also frequent use of these medicines for physical activity might be a sign that asthma is poorly controlled
                
leukotriene modifiers these pills are taken several hours before physical activity they can help relieve asthma symptoms brought on by physical activity
                
longterm control medicines frequent or severe symptoms due to physical activity may suggest poorly controlled asthma and the need to either start or increase longterm control medicines that reduce inflammation this will help prevent exerciserelated symptoms
                
easing into physical activity with a warmup period may be helpful you also may want to wear a mask or scarf over your mouth when exercising in cold weather
                
if you use your asthma medicines as your doctor directs you should be able to take part in any physical activity or sport you choose
                
people having surgery
                
asthma may add to the risk of having problems during and after surgery for instance having a tube put into your throat may cause an asthma attack
                
tell your surgeon about your asthma when you first talk with him or her the surgeon can take steps to lower your risk such as giving you asthma medicines before or during surgery"

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to maffucci syndrome ,in most people with maffucci syndrome the disorder is caused by mutations in the  or  gene these genes provide instructions for making enzymes called isocitrate dehydrogenase  and isocitrate dehydrogenase  respectively these enzymes convert a compound called isocitrate to another compound called  this reaction also produces a molecule called nadph which is necessary for many cellular processes  or  gene mutations cause the enzyme produced from the respective gene to take on a new abnormal function although these mutations have been found in some cells of enchondromas and hemangiomas in people with maffucci syndrome the relationship between the mutations and the signs and symptoms of the disorder is not well understood  mutations in other genes may also account for some cases of maffucci syndrome
inheritance,is buschkeollendorff syndrome inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder in many cases an affected person has a parent and other family members with the condition while most people with buschkeollendorff syndrome have both connective tissue nevi and osteopoikilosis some affected families include individuals who have the skin abnormalities alone or the bone abnormalities alone when osteopoikilosis occurs without connective tissue nevi the condition is often called isolated osteopoikilosis
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to mucolipidosis iii gamma ,mutations in the gnptg gene cause mucolipidosis iii gamma this gene provides instructions for making one part subunit of an enzyme called  this enzyme helps prepare certain newly made enzymes for transport to lysosomes lysosomes are compartments within the cell that use digestive enzymes to break down large molecules into smaller ones that can be reused by cells  is involved in the process of attaching a molecule called   to specific digestive enzymes just as luggage is tagged at the airport to direct it to the correct destination enzymes are often tagged after they are made so they get to where they are needed in the cell  acts as a tag that indicates a digestive enzyme should be transported to the lysosome  mutations in the gnptg gene that cause mucolipidosis iii gamma result in reduced activity of  these mutations disrupt the tagging of digestive enzymes with  which prevents many enzymes from reaching the lysosomes digestive enzymes that do not receive the  tag end up outside the cell where they have increased activity the shortage of digestive enzymes within lysosomes causes large molecules to accumulate there conditions that cause molecules to build up inside lysosomes including mucolipidosis iii gamma are called lysosomal storage disorders the signs and symptoms of mucolipidosis iii gamma are most likely due to the shortage of digestive enzymes inside lysosomes and the effects these enzymes have outside the cell
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina ,mutations in the oat gene cause gyrate atrophy the oat gene provides instructions for making the enzyme ornithine aminotransferase this enzyme is active in the energyproducing centers of cells mitochondria where it helps break down a molecule called ornithine ornithine is involved in the urea cycle which processes excess nitrogen in the form of ammonia that is generated when protein is broken down by the body in addition to its role in the urea cycle ornithine participates in several reactions that help ensure the proper balance of protein building blocks amino acids in the body this balance is important because a specific sequence of amino acids is required to build each of the many different proteins needed for the bodys functions the ornithine aminotransferase enzyme helps convert ornithine into another molecule called    can be converted into the amino acids glutamate and proline  oat gene mutations that cause gyrate atrophy result in a reduced amount of functional ornithine aminotransferase enzyme a shortage of this enzyme impedes the conversion of ornithine into  as a result excess ornithine accumulates in the blood hyperornithinemia and less  than normal is produced it is not clear how these changes result in the specific signs and symptoms of gyrate atrophy researchers have suggested that a deficiency of  may interfere with the function of the retina it has also been proposed that excess ornithine may suppress the production of a molecule called creatine creatine is needed for many tissues in the body to store and use energy properly it is involved in providing energy for muscle contraction and it is also important in nervous system functioning

treatment,what are the treatments for urine blockage in newborns ,"treatment for urine blockage depends on the cause and severity of the blockage hydronephrosis discovered before the baby is born rarely requires immediate action especially if it is only on one side the condition often goes away without any treatment before or after birth the health care provider should keep track of the condition with frequent ultrasounds
                
surgery
                
if the urine blockage threatens the life of the unborn baby a fetal surgeon may recommend surgery to insert a shunt or correct the problem causing the blockage a shunt is a small tube that can be inserted into the babys bladder to release urine into the amniotic sac the procedure is similar to amniocentesis in that a needle is inserted through the mothers abdomen ultrasound guides placement of the shunt which is attached to the end of the needle alternatively an endoscopea small flexible tube with a lightcan be used to place a shunt or to repair the problem causing the blockage fetal surgery carries many risks so it is performed only in special circumstances such as when the amniotic fluid is absent and the babys lungs are not developing or when the kidneys are severely damaged
                
if the urinary defect does not correct itself after the child is born and the child continues to have urine blockage surgery may be needed to remove the obstruction and restore urine flow the decision to operate depends on the degree of blockage after surgery a small tube called a stent may be placed in the ureter or urethra to keep it open temporarily while healing occurs
                
antibiotics
                
antibiotics are bacteriafighting medications a child with possible urine blockage or vur may be given antibiotics to prevent utis from developing until the urinary defect corrects itself or is corrected with surgery
                
intermittent catheterization
                
intermittent catheterization may be used for a child with urinary retention due to a nerve disease the parent or guardian and later the child is taught to drain the bladder by inserting a thin tube called a catheter through the urethra to the bladder emptying the bladder in this way helps to decrease kidney damage urine leakage and utis"

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to trichohepatoenteric syndrome ,trichohepatoenteric syndrome can be caused by mutations in the  or  gene these genes provide instructions for making proteins whose functions have not been confirmed researchers speculate that they work together with other proteins within cells to help recognize and break down excess or abnormal messenger rna mrna molecules mrna is a chemical cousin of dna that serves as the genetic blueprint for protein production studies suggest that getting rid of excess and abnormal mrna is important for cell growth  mutations in the  or  gene likely eliminate the function of their respective proteins which is hypothesized to impair the breakdown of unneeded mrna however it is unknown how these changes could lead to chronic diarrhea and the other features of trichohepatoenteric syndrome
treatment,what are the treatments for gestational trophoblastic disease ,"key points
                      there are different types of treatment for patients with gestational trophoblastic disease     three types of standard treatment are used          surgery      chemotherapy       radiation therapy          new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials      patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with gestational trophoblastic disease
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with gestational trophoblastic disease some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials before starting treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the nci website choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient family and health care team
                
                
                    three types of standard treatment are used
                    surgery    the doctor may remove the cancer using one of the following operations              dilatation and curettage dc with suction evacuation a surgical procedure to remove abnormal tissue and parts of the inner lining of the uterus the cervix is dilated and the material inside the uterus is removed with a small vacuumlike device the walls of the uterus are then gently scraped with a curette spoonshaped instrument to remove any material that may remain in the uterus this procedure may be used for molar pregnancies       hysterectomy surgery to remove the uterus and sometimes the cervix if the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy if the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision cut in the abdomen the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy if the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision cut in the abdomen using a laparoscope the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy              chemotherapy      chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated or whether the tumor is lowrisk or highrisk     combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug    even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any tumor cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy    see drugs approved for gestational trophoblastic disease for more information       radiation therapy      radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy              external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer       internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of gestational trophoblastic disease being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat gestational trophoblastic disease
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the nci website
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups    blood levels of beta human chorionic gonadotropin hcg will be checked for up to  months after treatment has ended this is because a hcg level that is higher than normal may mean that the tumor has not responded to treatment or it has become cancer

treatment,what are the treatments for pleurisy and other pleural disorders ,"pleurisy and other pleural disorders are treated with procedures medicines and other methods the goals of treatment include
                
relieving symptoms
                
removing the fluid air or blood from the pleural space if a large amount is present
                
treating the underlying condition
                
relieving symptoms
                
to relieve pleurisy symptoms your doctor may recommend
                
acetaminophen or antiinflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen to control pain
                
codeinebased cough syrups to controlcoughing
                
lying on your painful side this might make you more comfortable
                
breathing deeply and coughing to clear mucus as the pain eases otherwise you may developpneumonia
                
getting plenty of rest
                
removing fluid air or blood from the pleural space
                
your doctor may recommend removing fluid air or blood from your pleural space to prevent a lung collapse
                
the procedures used to drain fluid air or blood from the pleural space are similar
                
duringthoracentesis your doctor will insert a thin needle or plastic tube into the pleural space an attached syringe will draw fluid out of your chest this procedure can remove more than  cups of fluid at a time
                
if your doctor needs to remove a lot of fluid he or she may use a chest tube your doctor will inject a painkiller into the area of your chest wall where the fluid is he or she will then insert a plastic tube into your chest between two ribs the tube will be connected to a box that suctions out the fluid your doctor will use achest x ray to check the tubes position
                
your doctor also can use a chest tube to drain blood and air from the pleural space this process can take several days the tube will be left in place and youll likely stay in the hospital during this time
                
sometimes the fluid in the pleural space contains thick pus or blood clots it may form a hard skin or peel which makes the fluid harder to drain to help break up the pus or blood clots your doctor may use a chest tube to deliver medicines called fibrinolytics to the pleural space if the fluid still wont drain you may need surgery
                
if you have a small persistent air leak into the pleural space your doctor may attach a oneway valve to the chest tube the valve allows air to exit the pleural space but not reenter using this type of valve may allow you to continue your treatment from home
                
treat the underlying condition
                
the fluid sample that was removed during thoracentesis will be checked under a microscope this can tell your doctor whats causing the fluid buildup and he or she can decide the best way to treat it
                
if the fluid is infected treatment will involve antibiotics and drainage if you have tuberculosis or a fungal infection treatment will involve longterm use of antibiotics or antifungal medicines
                
if tumors in the pleura are causing fluid buildup the fluid may quickly build up again after its drained sometimes antitumor medicines will prevent further fluid buildup if they dont your doctor may seal the pleural space sealing the pleural space is called pleurodesis plurodehsis
                
for this procedure your doctor will drain all of the fluid out of your chest through a chest tube then he or she will push a substance through the chest tube into the pleural space the substance will irritate the surface of the pleura this will cause the two layers of the pleura to stick together preventing more fluid from building up
                
chemotherapy or radiation treatment also may be used to reduce the size of the tumors
                
ifheart failureis causing fluid buildup treatment usually includes diuretics medicines that help reduce fluid buildup and other medicines"

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to mannosebinding lectin deficiency ,relatively common mutations in the  gene can lead to mannosebinding lectin deficiency this gene provides instructions for making a protein that assembles into a complex called mannosebinding lectin functional mannosebinding lectins are made up of two to six protein groups called trimers which are each composed of three of the protein pieces subunits produced from the  gene  mannosebinding lectin plays an important role in the bodys immune response by attaching to foreign invaders such as bacteria viruses or yeast and turning on activating the complement system the complement system is a group of immune system proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders pathogens trigger inflammation and remove debris from cells and tissues mannosebinding lectin can also stimulate special immune cells to engulf and break down the attached pathogen  diseaseassociated mutations in the  gene can reduce the production of the mannosebinding lectin subunit or eliminate the subunits ability to assemble into functional mannosebinding lectin a decrease in the availability of the normal subunit protein may lead to a reduction of the functional mannosebinding lectin in blood with decreased levels of mannosebinding lectin the body does not recognize and fight foreign invaders efficiently consequently infections can be more common in people with this condition  however not everyone with a change in the  gene has decreased levels of mannosebinding lectin and not everyone with decreased protein levels is prone to infection researchers believe that a number of factors including other genetic and environmental factors are involved in the development of mannosebinding lectin deficiency and susceptibility to infection

information,what is are cystic fibrosis ,"cystic fibrosis sistik fibrosis or cf is an inherited disease of the secretory seekrehtoree glands secretory glands include glands that make mucus and sweat
                
inherited means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes people who have cf inherit two faulty genes for the diseaseone from each parent the parents likely dont have the disease themselves
                
cf mainly affects the lungs pancreas liver intestines sinuses and sex organs
                
overview
                
mucus is a substance made by tissues that line some organs and body cavities such as the lungs and nose normally mucus is a slippery watery substance it keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected
                
if you have cf your mucus becomes thick and sticky it builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs
                
the buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow this leads to repeated serious lung infections over time these infections can severely damage your lungs
                
the thick sticky mucus also can block tubes or ducts in your pancreas an organ in your abdomen as a result the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes cant reach your small intestine
                
these enzymes help break down food without them your intestines cant fully absorb fats and proteins this can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients pass through your body without being used you also may have bulky stools intestinal gas a swollen belly from severe constipation and pain or discomfort
                
cf also causes your sweat to become very salty thus when you sweat you lose large amounts of salt this can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause many health problems examples of these problems include dehydration a lack of fluid in your body increased heart rate fatigue tiredness weakness decreased blood pressure heat stroke and rarely death
                
if you or your child has cf youre also at higher risk for diabetes or two bonethinning conditions called osteoporosis osteoporosis and osteopenia osteopeeneeuh
                
cf also causes infertility in men and the disease can make it harder for women to get pregnant the term infertility refers to the inability to have children
                
outlook
                
the symptoms and severity of cf vary if you or your child has the disease you may have serious lung and digestive problems if the disease is mild symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years
                
the symptoms and severity of cf also vary over time sometimes youll have few symptoms other times your symptoms may become more severe as the disease gets worse youll have more severe symptoms more often
                
lung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have cf over time damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have cf
                
as treatments for cf continue to improve so does life expectancy for those who have the disease today some people who have cf are living into their forties or fifties or longer
                
early treatment for cf can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies medicines exercise and other treatments
                
your doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation pr pr is a broad program that helps improve the wellbeing of people who have chronic ongoing breathing problems"
information,what is are warfarin resistance ,warfarin resistance is a condition in which individuals have a high tolerance for the drug warfarin warfarin is an anticoagulant which means that it thins the blood preventing blood clots from forming warfarin is often prescribed to prevent blood clots in people with heart valve disease who have replacement heart valves people with an irregular heart beat atrial fibrillation or those with a history of heart attack stroke or a prior blood clot in the deep veins of the arms or legs deep vein thrombosis  there are two types of warfarin resistance incomplete and complete those with incomplete warfarin resistance can achieve the benefits of warfarin treatment with a high dose of warfarin individuals with complete warfarin resistance do not respond to warfarin treatment no matter how high the dose if people with warfarin resistance require treatment with warfarin and take the average dose they will remain at risk of developing a potentially harmful blood clot  both types of warfarin resistance are related to how the body processes warfarin in some people with warfarin resistance their blood clotting process does not react effectively to the drug others with this resistance rapidly break down metabolize warfarin so the medication is quickly processed by their bodies these individuals are classified as fast metabolizers or rapid metabolizers of warfarin the severity of these abnormal processes determines whether the warfarin resistance is complete or incomplete  warfarin resistance does not appear to cause any health problems other than those associated with warfarin drug treatment

symptoms,what are the symptoms of diabetes ,diabetes is often called a silent disease because it can cause serious complications even before you have symptoms symptoms can also be so mild that you dont notice them an estimated  million people in the united states have type  diabetes and dont know it according to  estimates by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc common signs some common symptoms of diabetes are  being very thirsty   frequent urination   feeling very hungry or tired   losing weight without trying   having sores that heal slowly   having dry itchy skin   loss of feeling or tingling in the feet   having blurry eyesight being very thirsty frequent urination feeling very hungry or tired losing weight without trying having sores that heal slowly having dry itchy skin loss of feeling or tingling in the feet having blurry eyesight signs of type  diabetes usually develop over a short period of time the signs for type  diabetes develop more gradually tests for diabetes the following tests are used to diagnose diabetes or prediabetes  an  test measures your average blood glucose levels over the past  months it can be used to diagnose type  diabetes and prediabetes it does not require fasting and blood can be drawn for the test any time of the day  an  test measures your average blood glucose levels over the past  months it can be used to diagnose type  diabetes and prediabetes it does not require fasting and blood can be drawn for the test any time of the day  a fasting plasma glucose or fpg test measures your blood glucose after you have gone at least  hours without eating doctors use this test to detect diabetes or prediabetes  a fasting plasma glucose or fpg test measures your blood glucose after you have gone at least  hours without eating doctors use this test to detect diabetes or prediabetes  in a random plasma glucose test your doctor checks your blood glucose without regard to when you ate your last meal this test along with an assessment of symptoms is used to diagnose diabetes but not prediabetes  in a random plasma glucose test your doctor checks your blood glucose without regard to when you ate your last meal this test along with an assessment of symptoms is used to diagnose diabetes but not prediabetes  an oral glucose tolerance test or ogtt measures your blood glucose after you have gone at least  hours without eating and  hours after you drink a sweet beverage doctors also use the oral glucose tolerance test to diagnose gestational diabetes in pregnant women  an oral glucose tolerance test or ogtt measures your blood glucose after you have gone at least  hours without eating and  hours after you drink a sweet beverage doctors also use the oral glucose tolerance test to diagnose gestational diabetes in pregnant women if any of these tests show that you might have diabetes your doctor will need to repeat the test with a second measurement unless there are clear symptoms of diabetes get more details about tests for diabetes who should get tested because type  diabetes is more common in older people anyone who is  or older should consider getting tested if you are  or older and overweight getting tested is strongly recommended if you are younger than  overweight and have one or more risk factors you also should talk with your doctor about being tested see risk factors for type  diabetes why early detection is important diabetes is a serious disease that can lead to a number of health problems such as heart disease stroke vision problems kidney disease and even death sometimes people have symptoms but do not suspect diabetes they delay scheduling a checkup because they do not feel sick many people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes complications such as a heart attack or stroke finding out early if you have diabetes is important because treatment can prevent or delay the complications of the disease
information,what is are pituitary tumors ,the pituitary is a small beansized gland that is below the hypothalamus a structure at the base of the brain by a threadlike stalk that contains both blood vessels and nerves it controls a system of hormones in the body that regulate growth metabolism the stress response and functions of the sex organs via the thyroid gland adrenal gland ovaries and testes a pituitary tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within the pituitary gland most pituitary tumors are benign which means they are noncancerous grow slowly and do not spread to other parts of the body however they can make the pituitary gland produce either too many or too few hormones which can cause problems in the body tumors that make hormones are called functioning tumors and they can cause a wide array of symptoms depending upon the hormone affected tumors that dont make hormones are called nonfunctioning tumors their symptoms are directly related to their growth in size and include headaches vision problems nausea and vomiting diseases related to hormone abnormalities include cushings disease in which fat builds up in the face back and chest and the arms and legs become very thin and acromegaly a condition in which the hands feet and face are larger than normal pituitary hormones that impact the sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone can make a woman produce breast milk even though she is not pregnant or nursing or cause a man to lose his sex drive or lower his sperm count pituitary tumors often go undiagnosed because their symptoms resemble those of so many other more common diseases

considerations,what to do for nutrition for advanced chronic kidney disease in adults , a person may prevent or delay some health problems from chronic kidney disease ckd by eating the right foods and avoiding foods high in sodium potassium and phosphorus   the kidneys remove wastes and extra water from the blood and make urine   medical nutrition therapy mnt is the use of counseling by a registered dietitian to help promote a medical or health goal   dietitians who specialize in helping people with ckd are called renal dietitians   people with advanced ckd often lose their appetites and consume fewer caloriesimportant units of energy in foodand may lose too much weight   eating more protein than the body needs may put an extra burden on the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster most peoplewith or without ckdcan get the daily protein they need by eating two  servings of meat or meat substitute   people with ckd are at higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke   everyone needs dietary fat but some fats are healthier than others   too much sodium in a persons diet can be harmful because it causes blood to hold fluid people with ckd need to be careful not to let too much fluid build up in their bodies   people with advanced ckd should avoid salt substitutes that use potassium because ckd limits the bodys ability to eliminate potassium from the blood   damaged kidneys allow potassium to build up in the blood causing serious heart problems potassium is found in many fruits and vegetables such as bananas potatoes avocados and melons   too much phosphorus in the blood pulls calcium from the bones making the bones weak and likely to break   people with advanced ckd may need to limit how much they drink because damaged kidneys cant remove extra fluid   many patients find that keeping track of their test results helps them see how their treatment is working patients can ask their health care provider for copies of their lab reports and ask to have them explained noting any results out of the normal range

excessive bleeding
                
the extent of bleeding depends on how severe the hemophilia is
                
children who have mild hemophilia may not have signs unless they have excessive bleeding from a dental procedure an accident or surgery males who have severe hemophilia may bleed heavily after circumcision
                
bleeding can occur on the bodys surface external bleeding or inside the body internal bleeding
                
signs of external bleeding may include
                
bleeding in the mouth from a cut or bite or from cutting or losing a tooth

bleeding in the knees elbows or other joints is another common form of internal bleeding in people who have hemophilia this bleeding can occur without obvious injury
                
at first the bleeding causes tightness in the joint with no real pain or any visible signs of bleeding the joint then becomes swollen hot to touch and painful to bend
                
swelling continues as bleeding continues eventually movement in the joint is temporarily lost pain can be severe joint bleeding that isnt treated quickly can damage the joint
                
bleeding in the brain

inheritance,is alphathalassemia inherited ,how is alphathalassemia inherited the inheritance of alphathalassemia is complex because the condition involves two genes  and  people have two copies of the  gene and two copies of the  gene in each cell each copy is called an allele therefore there are  alleles that produce alphaglobin the protein that results from these genes for each of the  genes one allele is inherited from a persons father and the other is inherited from a persons mother  so each person inherits  alleles from each parent the different types of alphathalassemia result from the loss of some or all of these alleles if both parents are missing at least one alphaglobin allele each of their children are at risk of having hb bart syndrome or hydrops fetalis hemoglobin h hbh disease or alphathalassemia trait the precise risk depends on how many alleles are missing and which combination of the  and  genes is affected in most cases a person with  mutated allele is a carrier and has no signs or symptoms a person with  mutated alleles may have mild signs or symptoms of alphathalassemia called alphathalassemia minor or alphathalassemia trait a person with  mutated alleles has moderate to severe symptoms called hbh disease when there are  mutated alleles the condition is called alphathalassemia major or hydrops fetalis in these cases an affected fetus usually does not survive to birth or an affected newborn does not survive long after birth

                     there are different types of treatment for patients with adult all      the treatment of adult all usually has two phases     four types of standard treatment are used           chemotherapy       radiation therapy       chemotherapy with stem cell transplant      targeted therapy          new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials           biologic therapy         patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial     patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment     patients with all may have late effects after treatment     followup tests may be needed
                
                
                    there are different types of treatment for patients with adult all
                    different types of treatment are available for patients with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia all some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment
                
                
                    the treatment of adult all usually has two phases
                    the treatment of adult all is done in phases           remission induction therapy this is the first phase of treatment the goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow this puts the leukemia into remission      postremission therapy this is the second phase of treatment it begins once the leukemia is in remission the goal of postremission therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse this phase is also called remission continuation therapy        treatment called central nervous system cns sanctuary therapy is usually given during each phase of therapy because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the cns brain and spinal cord the cells are able to find sanctuary hide in the cns systemic chemotherapy given in high doses intrathecal chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the brain are able to reach leukemia cells in the cns they are given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance the leukemia will recur come back cns sanctuary therapy is also called cns prophylaxis
                
                
                    four types of standard treatment are used
                    chemotherapy      chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid intrathecal chemotherapy an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated    intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat adult all that has spread or may spread to the brain and spinal cord when used to lessen the chance leukemia cells will spread to the brain and spinal cord it is called central nervous system cns sanctuary therapy or cns prophylaxis        see drugs approved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia for more information       radiation therapy      radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses highenergy xrays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy               external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer        internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer           the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer external radiation therapy may be used to treat adult all that has spread or may spread to the brain and spinal cord when used this way it is called central nervous system cns sanctuary therapy or cns prophylaxis external radiation therapy may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life       chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     stem cell transplant is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing bloodforming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored after the chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the bodys blood cells    see drugs approved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia for more information        targeted therapy      targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells    targeted therapy drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used to treat some types of adult all these drugs block the enzyme tyrosine kinase that causes stem cells to develop into more white blood cells blasts than the body needs three of the drugs used are imatinib mesylate gleevec dasatinib and nilotinib    see drugs approved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia for more information
                
                
                    new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials
                    this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website     biologic therapy     biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy
                
                
                    patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial
                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials
                
                
                    patients with all may have late effects after treatment
                    side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects late effects of treatment for all may include the risk of second cancers new types of cancer regular followup exams are very important for longterm survivors
                
                
                    followup tests may be needed
                    some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests   some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called followup tests or checkups

prevention,how to prevent urinary tract infection in adults ,"changing some daily habits may help a person prevent recurrent utis
                
eating diet and nutrition
                
drinking lots of fluid can help flush bacteria from the system water is best most people should try for six to eight  glasses a day talk with your health care provider if you cant drink the recommended amount due to other health problems such as urinary incontinence urinary frequency or kidney failure
                
urination habits
                
a person should urinate often and when the urge arises bacteria can grow when urine stays in the bladder too long women and men should urinate shortly after sex to flush away bacteria that might have entered the urethra during sex drinking a glass of water will also help flush bacteria away
                
after using the toilet women should wipe from front to back this step is most important after a bowel movement to keep bacteria from getting into the urethra
                
clothing
                
cotton underwear and loosefitting clothes should be worn so air can keep the area around the urethra dry tightfitting jeans and nylon underwear should be avoided because they can trap moisture and help bacteria grow
                
birth control
                
for women using a diaphragm or spermicide for birth control can lead to utis by increasing bacteria growth a woman who has trouble with utis should try switching to a new form of birth control unlubricated condoms or spermicidal condoms increase irritation which may help bacteria grow switching to lubricated condoms without spermicide or using a nonspermicidal lubricant may help prevent utis"

information,what is are parasites  american trypanosomiasis also known as chagas disease ,"chagas disease is caused by the parasite trypanosoma cruzi which is transmitted to animals and people by insect vectors that are found only in the americas mainly in rural areas of latin america where poverty is widespread chagas disease t cruzi infection is also referred to as american trypanosomiasis
it is estimated that as many as  million people in mexico central america and south america have chagas disease most of whom do not know they are infected if untreated infection is lifelong and can be life threatening
the impact of chagas disease is not limited to the rural areas in latin america in which vectorborne transmission occurs largescale population movements from rural to urban areas of latin america and to other regions of the world have increased the geographic distribution and changed the epidemiology of chagas disease in the united states and in other regions where chagas disease is now found but is not endemic control strategies should focus on preventing transmission from blood transfusion organ transplantation and mothertobaby congenital transmission"

information,what is are mitochondrial myopathy ,mitochondrial myopathies are a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to the mitochondriasmall energyproducing structures that serve as the cells power plants nerve cells in the brain and muscles require a great deal of energy and thus appear to be particularly damaged when mitochondrial dysfunction occurs some of the more common mitochondrial myopathies include kearnssayre syndrome myoclonus epilepsy with raggedred fibers and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes the symptoms of mitochondrial myopathies include muscle weakness or exercise intolerance heart failure or rhythm disturbances dementia movement disorders strokelike episodes deafness blindness droopy eyelids limited mobility of the eyes vomiting and seizures the prognosis for these disorders ranges in severity from progressive weakness to death most mitochondrial myopathies occur before the age of  and often begin with exercise intolerance or muscle weakness during physical activity muscles may become easily fatigued or weak muscle cramping is rare but may occur nausea headache and breathlessness are also associated with these disorders
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to congenital hypothyroidism ,congenital hypothyroidism can be caused by a variety of factors only some of which are genetic the most common cause worldwide is a shortage of iodine in the diet of the mother and the affected infant iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones genetic causes account for about  to  percent of cases of congenital hypothyroidism  the cause of the most common type of congenital hypothyroidism thyroid dysgenesis is usually unknown studies suggest that  to  percent of cases are inherited two of the genes involved in this form of the condition are  and tshr these genes play roles in the proper growth and development of the thyroid gland mutations in these genes prevent or disrupt normal development of the gland the abnormal or missing gland cannot produce normal amounts of thyroid hormones  thyroid dyshormonogenesis results from mutations in one of several genes involved in the production of thyroid hormones these genes include   tg and tpo mutations in each of these genes disrupt a step in thyroid hormone synthesis leading to abnormally low levels of these hormones mutations in the tshb gene disrupt the synthesis of thyroid hormones by impairing the stimulation of hormone production changes in this gene are the primary cause of central hypothyroidism the resulting shortage of thyroid hormones disrupts normal growth brain development and metabolism leading to the features of congenital hypothyroidism  mutations in other genes that have not been as well characterized can also cause congenital hypothyroidism still other genes are involved in syndromic forms of the disorder
causes,what causes heart murmur ,"innocent heart murmurs
                
why some people have innocent heart murmurs and others do not isnt known innocent murmurs are simply sounds made by blood flowing through the hearts chambers and valves or through blood vessels near the heart
                
extra blood flow through the heart also may cause innocent heart murmurs after childhood the most common cause of extra blood flow through the heart is pregnancy this is because during pregnancy womens bodies make extra blood most heart murmurs that occur in pregnant women are innocent
                
abnormal heart murmurs
                
congenital heart defects or acquired heart valve disease often are the cause of abnormal heart murmurs
                
congenital heart defects
                
congenital heart defects are the most common cause of abnormal heart murmurs in children these defects are problems with the hearts structure that are present at birth they change the normal flow of blood through the heart
                
congenital heart defects can involve the interior walls of the heart the valves inside the heart or the arteries and veins that carry blood to and from the heart some babies are born with more than one heart defect
                
heart valve problems septal defects also called holes in the heart and diseases of the heart muscle such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are common heart defects that cause abnormal heart murmurs
                
examples of valve problems are narrow valves that limit blood flow or leaky valves that dont close properly septal defects are holes in the wall that separates the right and left sides of the heart this wall is called the septum
                
a hole in the septum between the hearts two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect a hole in the septum between the hearts two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect
                
hypertrophic hipertrofik cardiomyopathy kardeomiopahthee hcm occurs if heart muscle cells enlarge and cause the walls of the ventricles usually the left ventricle to thicken the thickening may block blood flow out of the ventricle if a blockage occurs the ventricle must work hard to pump blood to the body hcm also can affect the hearts mitral valve causing blood to leak backward through the valve
                
heart defects that can cause abnormal heart murmurs
                

                
for more information go to the health topics congenital heart defects article
                
acquired heart valve disease
                
acquired heart valve disease often is the cause of abnormal heart murmurs in adults this is heart valve disease that develops as the result of another condition
                
many conditions can cause heart valve disease examples include heart conditions and other disorders agerelated changes rheumatic rumatik fever and infections
                
heart conditions and other disorders certain conditions can stretch and distort the heart valves such as
                
damage and scar tissue from a heart attack or injury to the heart
                
advanced high blood pressure and heart failure these conditions can enlarge the heart or its main arteries
                
agerelated changes as you get older calcium deposits or other deposits may form on your heart valves these deposits stiffen and thicken the valve flaps and limit blood flow this stiffening and thickening of the valve is called sclerosis sklerosis
                
rheumatic fever the bacteria that cause strep throat scarlet fever and in some cases impetigo impehtigo also can cause rheumatic fever this serious illness can develop if you have an untreated or not fully treated streptococcal strep infection
                
rheumatic fever can damage and scar the heart valves the symptoms of this heart valve damage often dont occur until many years after recovery from rheumatic fever
                
today most people who have strep infections are treated with antibiotics before rheumatic fever develops its very important to take all of the antibiotics your doctor prescribes for strep throat even if you feel better before the medicine is gone
                
infections common germs that enter the bloodstream and get carried to the heart can sometimes infect the inner surface of the heart including the heart valves this rare but sometimes lifethreatening infection is called infective endocarditis endokarditis or ie
                
ie is more likely to develop in people who already have abnormal blood flow through a heart valve because of heart valve disease the abnormal blood flow causes blood clots to form on the surface of the valve the blood clots make it easier for germs to attach to and infect the valve
                
ie can worsen existing heart valve disease
                
other causes
                
some heart murmurs occur because of an illness outside of the heart the heart is normal but an illness or condition can cause blood flow thats faster than normal examples of this type of illness include fever anemia uhneemeeh and hyperthyroidism
                
anemia is a condition in which the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the body has too much thyroid hormone"

information,what is are wolfram syndrome ,wolfram syndrome is a condition that affects many of the bodys systems the hallmark features of wolfram syndrome are high blood sugar levels resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin diabetes mellitus and progressive vision loss due to degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain optic atrophy people with wolfram syndrome often also have pituitary gland dysfunction that results in the excretion of excessive amounts of urine diabetes insipidus hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear sensorineural deafness urinary tract problems reduced amounts of the sex hormone testosterone in males hypogonadism or neurological or psychiatric disorders  diabetes mellitus is typically the first symptom of wolfram syndrome usually diagnosed around age  nearly everyone with wolfram syndrome who develops diabetes mellitus requires insulin replacement therapy optic atrophy is often the next symptom to appear usually around age  the first signs of optic atrophy are loss of color vision and side peripheral vision over time the vision problems get worse and people with optic atrophy are usually blind within approximately  years after signs of optic atrophy first begin  in diabetes insipidus the pituitary gland which is located at the base of the brain does not function normally this abnormality disrupts the release of a hormone called vasopressin which helps control the bodys water balance and urine production approximately  percent of people with wolfram syndrome have diabetes insipidus pituitary gland dysfunction can also cause hypogonadism in males the lack of testosterone that occurs with hypogonadism affects growth and sexual development about  percent of people with wolfram syndrome have sensorineural deafness that can range in severity from deafness beginning at birth to mild hearing loss beginning in adolescence that worsens over time sixty to  percent of people with wolfram syndrome have a urinary tract problem urinary tract problems include obstruction of the ducts between the kidneys and bladder ureters a large bladder that cannot empty normally highcapacity atonal bladder disrupted urination bladder sphincter dyssynergia and difficulty controlling the flow of urine incontinence  about  percent of people with wolfram syndrome develop a neurological or psychiatric disorder most commonly problems with balance and coordination ataxia typically beginning in early adulthood other neurological problems experienced by people with wolfram syndrome include irregular breathing caused by the brains inability to control breathing central apnea loss of the sense of smell loss of the gag reflex muscle spasms myoclonus seizures reduced sensation in the lower extremities peripheral neuropathy and intellectual impairment psychiatric disorders associated with wolfram syndrome include psychosis episodes of severe depression and impulsive and aggressive behavior  there are two types of wolfram syndrome with many overlapping features the two types are differentiated by their genetic cause in addition to the usual features of wolfram syndrome individuals with wolfram syndrome type  have stomach or intestinal ulcers and excessive bleeding after an injury the tendency to bleed excessively combined with the ulcers typically leads to abnormal bleeding in the gastrointestinal system people with wolfram syndrome type  do not develop diabetes insipidus  wolfram syndrome is often fatal by midadulthood due to complications from the many features of the condition such as health problems related to diabetes mellitus or neurological problems
information,what is are arrhythmia ,"espaol
                
an arrhythmia ahrithmeah is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat during an arrhythmia the heart can beat too fast too slow or with an irregular rhythm
                
a heartbeat that is too fast is called tachycardia takihkardeah a heartbeat that is too slow is called bradycardia braydekardeah
                
most arrhythmias are harmless but some can be serious or even life threatening during an arrhythmia the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body lack of blood flow can damage the brain heart and other organs
                
understanding the hearts electrical system
                
to understand arrhythmias it helps to understand the hearts internal electrical system the hearts electrical system controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat
                
with each heartbeat an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom as the signal travels it causes the heart to contract and pump blood
                
each electrical signal begins in a group of cells called the sinus node or sinoatrial sa node the sa node is located in the hearts upper right chamber the right atrium aytreeum in a healthy adult heart at rest the sa node fires off an electrical signal to begin a new heartbeat  to  times a minute
                
from the sa node the electrical signal travels through special pathways in the right and left atria this causes the atria to contract and pump blood into the hearts two lower chambers the ventricles ventrihkuls
                
the electrical signal then moves down to a group of cells called the atrioventricular av node located between the atria and the ventricles here the signal slows down just a little allowing the ventricles time to finish filling with blood
                
the electrical signal then leaves the av node and travels along a pathway called the bundle of his this pathway divides into a right bundle branch and a left bundle branch the signal goes down these branches to the ventricles causing them to contract and pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body
                
the ventricles then relax and the heartbeat process starts all over again in the sa node for more information about the hearts electrical system including detailed animations go to the health topics how the heart works article
                
a problem with any part of this process can cause an arrhythmia for example in atrial fibrillation atreal fibrilashun a common type of arrhythmia electrical signals travel through the atria in a fast and disorganized way this causes the atria to quiver instead of contract
                
outlook
                
there are many types of arrhythmia most arrhythmias are harmless but some are not the outlook for a person who has an arrhythmia depends on the type and severity of the arrhythmia
                
even serious arrhythmias often can be successfully treated most people who have arrhythmias are able to live normal healthy lives"

information,what is are xlinked infantile spasm syndrome ,xlinked infantile spasm syndrome is a seizure disorder characterized by a type of seizure known as infantile spasms the spasms usually appear before the age of  several types of spasms have been described but the most commonly reported involves bending at the waist and neck with extension of the arms and legs sometimes called a jackknife spasm each spasm lasts only seconds but they occur in clusters several minutes long although individuals are not usually affected while they are sleeping the spasms commonly occur just after awakening infantile spasms usually disappear by age  but many children then develop other types of seizures that recur throughout their lives  most babies with xlinked infantile spasm syndrome have characteristic results on an electroencephalogram eeg a test used to measure the electrical activity of the brain the eeg of these individuals typically shows an irregular pattern known as hypsarrhythmia and this finding can help differentiate infantile spasms from other types of seizures  because of the recurrent seizures babies with xlinked infantile spasm syndrome stop developing normally and begin to lose skills they have acquired developmental regression such as sitting rolling over and babbling subsequently development in affected children is delayed most affected individuals also have intellectual disability throughout their lives
genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ,the familial form of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is caused by mutations in the avp gene this gene provides instructions for making a hormone called vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone adh this hormone which is produced and stored in the brain helps control the bodys water balance  the kidneys filter the blood to remove waste and excess fluid which are stored in the bladder as urine adh controls the balance between fluid intake and urine excretion normally when a persons fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost for example through sweating the brain releases more adh into the bloodstream high levels of this hormone direct the kidneys to reabsorb more water and to make less urine when fluid intake is adequate the brain releases less adh lower levels of this hormone cause the kidneys to reabsorb less water and to make more urine  mutations in the avp gene result in progressive damage to the brain cells where adh is produced these cells ultimately die causing a shortage of adh without this hormone the kidneys do not reabsorb water as they should and the body makes excessive amounts of urine these problems with water balance are characteristic of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus  the acquired form of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus results when the areas of the brain that produce or store adh are damaged by head injuries brain tumors brain surgery certain diseases and infections or bleeding in the brain a loss of adh disrupts the bodys water balance leading to excessive urine production and the other features of the disorder  in  to  percent of all cases of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus the cause of the disorder is unknown studies suggest that some of these cases may have an autoimmune basis autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the bodys own tissues and organs for unknown reasons in some people with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus the immune system appears to damage the brain cells that normally produce adh

inheritance,is hereditary angioedema inherited ,this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder  in some cases an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family
causes,what causes thrombocythemia and thrombocytosis ,"primary thrombocythemia
                
in this condition faulty stem cells in the bone marrow make too many platelets what causes this to happen usually isnt known when this process occurs without other blood cell disorders its called essential thrombocythemia
                
a rare form of thrombocythemia is inherited inherited means the condition is passed from parents to children through the genes in some cases a genetic mutation may cause the condition
                
in addition to the bone marrow making too many platelets the platelets also are abnormal in primary thrombocythemia they may form blood clots or surprisingly cause bleeding when they dont work well
                
bleeding also can occur because of a condition that develops called von willebrand disease this condition affects the blood clotting process
                
after many years scarring of the bone marrow can occur
                
secondary thrombocytosis
                
this condition occurs if another disease condition or outside factor causes the platelet count to rise for example  percent of people who have high platelet counts also have cancermostly lung gastrointestinal breast ovarian and lymphoma sometimes a high platelet count is the first sign of cancer
                
other conditions or factors that can cause a high platelet count are
                
irondeficiency anemia uhneemeuh
                
hemolytic heemohlitick anemia
                
absence of a spleen after surgery to remove the organ
                
inflammatory or infectious diseases such as connective tissue disorders inflammatory bowel disease and tuberculosis
                
reactions to medicine
                
some conditions can lead to a high platelet count that lasts for only a short time examples of such conditions include
                
recovery from serious blood loss
                
recovery from a very low platelet count caused by excessive alcohol use and lack of vitamin  or folate
                
acute shortterm infection or inflammation
                
response to physical activity
                
although the platelet count is high in secondary thrombocytosis the platelets are normal unlike in primary thrombocythemia thus people who have secondary thrombocytosis have a lower risk of blood clots and bleeding"
susceptibility,who is at risk for bronchiectasis ,"people who have conditions that damage the lungs or increase the risk of lung infections are at risk for bronchiectasis such conditions include
                
cystic fibrosis this disease leads to almost half of the cases of bronchiectasis in the united states
                
immunodeficiency disorders such as common variable immunodeficiency and less often hiv and aids
                
allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis this is an allergic reaction to a fungus called aspergillus the reaction causes swelling in the airways
                
disorders that affect cilia function such as primary ciliary dyskinesia cilia are small hairlike structures that line your airways they help clear mucus a slimy substance out of your airways

exams and tests,how to diagnose parasites  cyclosporiasis cyclospora infection ,"clinical diagnosis
    
health care providers should consider cyclospora as a potential cause of prolonged diarrheal illness particularly in patients with a history of recent travel to cyclosporaendemic areas testing for cyclospora is not routinely done in most us laboratories even when stool is tested for parasites therefore if indicated health care providers should specifically request testing for cyclospora
    
more on resources for health professionals diagnosis
    laboratory diagnosis
    
cyclospora infection is diagnosed by examining stool specimens diagnosis can be difficult in part because even persons who are symptomatic might not shed enough oocysts in their stool to be readily detectable by laboratory examinations therefore patients might need to submit several specimens collected on different days
    
special techniques such as acidfast staining are often used to make cyclospora oocysts more visible under the microscope in addition cyclospora oocysts are autofluorescent meaning that when stool containing the parasite is viewed under an ultraviolet uv fluorescence microscope the parasite appears blue or green against a black background molecular diagnostic methods such as polymerase chain reaction pcr analysis are used to look for the parasites dna in the stool

susceptibility,who is at risk for irondeficiency anemia ,"infants and young children
                
infants and young children need a lot of iron to grow and develop the iron that fullterm infants have stored in their bodies is used up in the first  to  months of life
                
premature and lowbirthweight babies weighing less than  pounds are at even greater risk for irondeficiency anemia these babies dont have as much iron stored in their bodies as larger fullterm infants
                
ironfortified baby food or iron supplements when used properly can help prevent irondeficiency anemia in infants and young children talk with your childs doctor about your childs diet
                
young children who drink a lot of cows milk may be at risk for irondeficiency anemia milk is low in iron and too much milk may take the place of ironrich foods in the diet too much milk also may prevent childrens bodies from absorbing iron from other foods
                
children who have lead in their blood also may be at risk for irondeficiency anemia lead can interfere with the bodys ability to make hemoglobin lead may get into the body from breathing in lead dust eating lead in paint or soil or drinking water that contains lead
                
teens
                
teens are at risk for irondeficiency anemia if theyre underweight or have chronic ongoing illnesses teenage girls who have heavy periods also are at increased risk for the condition
                
women
                
women of childbearing age are at higher risk for irondeficiency anemia because of blood loss during their monthly periods about  in  women of childbearing age has irondeficiency anemia
                
pregnant women also are at higher risk for the condition because they need twice as much iron as usual the extra iron is needed for increased blood volume and for the fetus growth
                
about half of all pregnant women develop irondeficiency anemia the condition can increase a pregnant womans risk for a premature or lowbirthweight baby
                
adults who have internal bleeding
                
adults who have internal bleeding such as intestinal bleeding can develop irondeficiency anemia due to blood loss certain conditions such as colon cancer and bleeding ulcers can cause blood loss some medicines such as aspirin also can cause internal bleeding
                
other atrisk groups
                
people who get kidney dialysis treatment may develop irondeficiency anemia this is because blood is lost during dialysis also the kidneys are no longer able to make enough of a hormone that the body needs to produce red blood cells
                
people who have gastric bypass surgery also may develop irondeficiency anemia this type of surgery can prevent the body from absorbing enough iron
                
certain eating patterns or habits may put you at higher risk for irondeficiency anemia this can happen if you
                
follow a diet that excludes meat and fish which are the best sources of iron however vegetarian diets can provide enough iron if you eat the right foods for example good nonmeat sources of iron include ironfortified breads and cereals beans tofu dried fruits and spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables
                
eat poorly because of money social health or other problems
                
follow a very lowfat diet over a long time some higher fat foods like meat are the best sources of iron
                
follow a highfiber diet large amounts of fiber can slow the absorption of iron"

information,what is are asbestosrelated lung diseases ,"asbestosrelated lung diseases are diseases caused by exposure to asbestos asbestos fibers asbestos is a mineral that in the past was widely used in many industries
                
asbestos is made up of tiny fibers that can escape into the air when breathed in these fibers can stay in your lungs for a long time if the fibers build up in your lungs they can lead to
                
pleural plaque in this condition the tissue around the lungs and diaphragm the muscle below your lungs thickens and hardens this tissue is called the pleura pleural plaque usually causes no symptoms rarely as the pleura thickens it can trap and compress part of the lung this may show up as a mass on an xray image
                
pleural effusion in this condition excess fluid builds up in the pleural space the pleural space is the area between the lungs and the chest wall
                
asbestosis asbestoesis in this condition the lung tissue becomes scarred people who have asbestosis are at greater risk for lung cancer especially if they smoke
                
lung cancer this type of cancer forms in the lung tissue usually in the cells lining the air passages
                
mesothelioma mezotheeleeoma this disease is cancer of the pleura
                
asbestos also can cause cancer in the lining of the abdominal cavity this lining is known as the peritoneum perihtoneum
                
asbestosrelated lung diseases
                

                
overview
                
until the  asbestos was widely used in many industries in the united states for example it was used to insulate pipes boilers and ships make brakes strengthen cement and fireproof many items such as drywall
                
people who worked around asbestos during that time are at risk for asbestosrelated lung diseases people at highest risk include
                
unprotected workers who made installed or removed products containing asbestos people who worked near others who did these jobs also are at risk
                
family members of workers who were exposed to asbestos family members may have breathed in asbestos fibers that workers brought home on their clothes shoes or bodies
                
people who live in areas with large deposits of asbestos in the soil this risk is limited to areas where the deposits were disturbed and asbestos fibers got into the air
                
asbestos fibers also can be released into the air when older buildings containing asbestosmade products are destroyed removing these products during building renovations also can release asbestos fibers into the air
                
generally being around asbestosmade products isnt a danger as long as the asbestos is enclosed this prevents the fibers from getting into the air
                
people in the united states are less likely to have asbestosrelated lung diseases now because the mineral is no longer widely used
                
the use of asbestos is heavily restricted and rules and standards are now in place to protect workers and others from asbestos exposure asbestos is found in only a few new products such as gaskets used in brakes
                
however many countries do not yet restrict asbestos use people in those countries are still exposed to the mineral
                
outlook
                
the outlook for people who have asbestosrelated lung diseases can vary it will depend on which disease a person has and how much it has damaged the lungs
                
no treatments can reverse the effects of asbestos on your lungs however treatments may help relieve symptoms slow the progress of the disease and prevent complications
                
if youve been exposed to asbestos let your doctor know he or she can watch you for signs of asbestosrelated problems and start treatment early if needed early treatment may help prevent or delay complications
                
quitting smoking and making other lifestyle changes may help people who are at high risk for asbestosrelated lung diseases these lifestyle changes may prevent more serious diseases such as cancer"
inheritance,is stargardt disease inherited ,how is stargardt disease inherited stargardt disease is most commonly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner this means that to be affected a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent who is referred to as a carrier carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms they are unaffected when  carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children each child has a   in  chance to be affected   in  chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent  chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier a person with autosomal recessive stargardt disease will always pass one mutated copy of the gene to each of hisher children in other words each of hisher children will at least be a carrier  a child of an affected person can be affected if the other parent is also affected or is a carrier in rare cases stargardt disease may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner this means that having a mutation in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition an affected person typically inherits the mutated gene from an affected parent when a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children each child has a   in  chance to inherit that mutation

symptoms,what are the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome cfs ,"chronic fatigue syndrome can be misdiagnosed or overlooked because its symptoms are similar to so many other illnesses fatigue for instance can be a symptom for hundreds of illnesses looking closer at the nature of the symptoms though can help a doctor distinguish cfs from other illnesses
  primary symptoms
  
as the name chronic fatigue syndrome suggests fatigue is one part of this illness with cfs however the fatigue is accompanied by other symptoms in addition the fatigue is not the kind you might feel after a particularly busy day or week after a sleepless night or after a single stressful event its a severe incapacitating fatigue that isnt improved by bed rest and that is often worsened by physical activity or mental exertion its an allencompassing fatigue that can dramatically reduce a persons activity level and stamina
  
people with cfs function at a significantly lower level of activity than they were capable of before they became ill the illness results in a substantial reduction in workrelated personal social and educational activities
  
the fatigue of cfs is accompanied by characteristic illness symptoms lasting at least  months these symptoms include
  
    increased malaise extreme exhaustion and sickness following physical activity or mental exertion
    problems with sleep
    difficulties with memory and concentration
    persistent muscle pain
    joint pain without redness or swelling
    headache
    tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpit
    sore throat
  
  other symptoms
  
the symptoms listed above are the symptoms used to diagnose cfs however many cfs patients and patients in general may experience other symptoms including
  
    brain fog feeling like youre in a mental fog
    difficulty maintaining an upright position dizziness balance problems or fainting
    allergies or sensitivities to foods odors chemicals medications or noise
    irritable bowel
    chills and night sweats
    visual disturbances sensitivity to light blurring eye pain
    depression or mood problems irritability mood swings anxiety panic attacks
  
  
its important to tell your health care professional if youre experiencing any of these symptoms you might have cfs or you might have another treatable disorder only a health care professional can diagnose cfs
  whats the clinical course of cfs
  
the severity of cfs varies from patient to patient some people can maintain fairly active lives for most patients however cfs significantly limits their work school and family activities for periods of time
  
while symptoms vary from person to person in number type and severity all cfs patients are limited in what they can do to some degree cdc studies show that cfs can be as disabling as multiple sclerosis lupus rheumatoid arthritis heart disease endstage renal disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and similar chronic conditions
  
cfs often affects patients in cycles patients will have periods of illness followed by periods of relative wellbeing for some patients symptoms may diminish or even go into complete remission however they often recur at a later point in time this pattern of remission and relapse makes cfs especially hard for patients to manage patients who are in remission may be tempted to overdo activities when theyre feeling better but this overexertion may actually contribute to a relapse
  
the percentage of cfs patients who recover is unknown but there is some evidence to indicate that patients benefit when accompanying conditions are identified and treated and when symptoms are managed highquality health care is important"

outlook,what is the outlook for oxygen therapy ,"during an emergencysuch as a serious accident possible heart attack or other lifethreatening eventyou might be started on oxygen therapy right away
                
otherwise your doctor will decide whether you need oxygen therapy based on test results an arterial blood gas test and a pulse oximetry test can measure the amount of oxygen in your blood
                
for an arterial blood gas test a small needle is inserted into an artery usually in your wrist a sample of blood is taken from the artery the sample is then sent to a laboratory where its oxygen level is measured
                
for a pulse oximetry test a small sensor is attached to your fingertip or toe the sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood
                
if the tests show that your blood oxygen level is low your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy in the prescription your doctor will include the number of liters of oxygen per minute that you need oxygen flow rate he or she also will include how often you need to use the oxygen frequency of use
                
frequency of use includes when and for how long you should use the oxygen depending on your condition and blood oxygen level you may need oxygen only at certain times such as during sleep or while exercising
                
if your doctor prescribes home oxygen therapy he or she can help you find a home equipment provider the provider will give you the equipment and other supplies you need"

causes,what causes creutzfeldtjakob disease ,what causes creutzfeldtjakob disease some researchers believe an unusual slow virus or another organism causes creutzfeldtjakob disease cjd however they have never been able to isolate a virus or other organism in people with the disease furthermore the agent that causes cjd has several characteristics that are unusual for known organisms such as viruses and bacteria it is difficult to kill it does not appear to contain any genetic information in the form of nucleic acids dna or rna and it usually has a long incubation period before symptoms appear in some cases the incubation period may be as long as  years the leading scientific theory at this time maintains that cjd and the other tses are caused by a type of protein called a prion prion proteins occur in both a normal form which is a harmless protein found in the bodys cells and in an infectious form which causes disease the harmless and infectious forms of the prion protein have the same sequence of amino acids the building blocks of proteins but the infectious form of the protein takes a different folded shape than the normal protein sporadic cjd may develop because some of a persons normal prions spontaneously change into the infectious form of the protein and then alter the prions in other cells in a chain reaction once they appear abnormal prion proteins aggregate or clump together investigators think these protein aggregates may lead to the neuron loss and other brain damage seen in cjd however they do not know exactly how this damage occurs about  to  percent of all cjd cases are inherited these cases arise from a mutation or change in the gene that controls formation of the normal prion protein while prions themselves do not contain genetic information and do not require genes to reproduce themselves infectious prions can arise if a mutation occurs in the gene for the bodys normal prion protein if the prion protein gene is altered in a persons sperm or egg cells the mutation can be transmitted to the persons offspring several different mutations in the prion gene have been identified the particular mutation found in each family affects how frequently the disease appears and what symptoms are most noticeable however not all people with mutations in the prion protein gene develop cjd
susceptibility,who is at risk for what i need to know about interstitial cystitispainful bladder syndrome ,"both men and women can get icpbs though twice as many women are affected as men it can occur at any age but it is most common in middle age
                
people with icpbs rarely have bladder pain all the time the pain usually comes and goes as the bladder fills and then empties the pain may go away for weeks or months and then return people with icpbs sometimes refer to an attack of bladder pain as a flare or flareup stress may bring on a flareup of symptoms in someone who has icpbs but stress does not cause a person to get icpbs"

                    for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment   many of todays standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment   patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward
                
                
                    patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment
                    some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment   clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from ncis listing of clinical trials

surgery or procedures
                
bypass grafting
                
your doctor may recommend bypass grafting surgery if blood flow in your limb is blocked or nearly blocked for this surgery your doctor uses a blood vessel from another part of your body or a synthetic tube to make a graft
                
this graft bypasses that is goes around the blocked part of the artery the bypass allows blood to flow around the blockage this surgery doesnt cure pad but it may increase blood flow to the affected limb
                

                
angioplasty and stent placement
                
your doctor may recommend angioplasty to restore blood flow through a narrowed or blockedartery
                
during this procedure a catheter thin tube with a balloon at the tip is inserted into a blocked artery the balloon is then inflated which pushes plaque outward against the artery wall this widens the artery and restores blood flow
                

                
a stent a small mesh tube may be placed in the artery during angioplasty a stent helps keep the artery open after angioplasty is done some stents are coated with medicine to help prevent blockages in the artery
                

                
atherectomy
                
atherectomy is a procedure that removes plaque buildup from an artery during the procedure a catheter is used to insert a small cutting device into the blocked artery the device is used to shave or cut off plaque
                
the bits of plaque are removed from the body through the catheter or washed away in the bloodstream if theyre small enough
                

                
doctors also can perform atherectomy using a special laser that dissolves the blockage

your doctor also may recommend blood tests these tests can help your doctor find out whether youve had a heart attack the cause of your pericarditis and how inflamed your pericardium is"
information,what is are chronic fatigue syndrome cfs ,"chronic fatigue syndrome or cfs is a devastating and complex disorder people with cfs have overwhelming fatigue and a host of other symptoms that are not improved by bed rest and that can get worse after physical activity or mental exertion they often function at a substantially lower level of activity than they were capable of before they became ill
  
besides severe fatigue other symptoms include muscle pain impaired memory or mental concentration insomnia and postexertion malaise lasting more than  hours in some cases cfs can persist for years
  
researchers have not yet identified what causes cfs and there are no tests to diagnose cfs moreover because many illnesses have fatigue as a symptom doctors need to take care to rule out other conditions which may be treatable"

specialists involved
                
your primary care doctor may refer you to a cardiothoracic or vascular surgeon for diagnosis and treatment of an aortic aneurysm
                
a cardiothoracic surgeon does surgery on the heart lungs and other organs and structures in the chest including the aorta a vascular surgeon does surgery on the aorta and other blood vessels except those of the heart and brain
                
diagnostic tests and procedures
                
to diagnose and study an aneurysm your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests
                
ultrasound and echocardiography
                
ultrasound and echocardiography echo are simple painless tests that use sound waves to create pictures of the structures inside your body these tests can show the size of an aortic aneurysm if one is found
                
computed tomography scan

susceptibility,who is at risk for sleep apnea ,"obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition about half of the people who have this condition are overweight
                
men are more likely than women to have sleep apnea although the condition can occur at any age the risk increases as you get older a family history of sleep apnea also increases your risk for the condition
                
people who have small airways in their noses throats or mouths are more likely to have sleep apnea small airways might be due to the shape of these structures or allergies or other conditions that cause congestion
                
small children might have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats enlarged tonsil tissues raise a childs risk for sleep apnea overweight children also might be at increased risk for sleep apnea
                
about half of the people who have sleep apnea also have high blood pressure sleep apnea also is linked to smoking metabolic syndrome diabetes and risk factors for stroke and heart failure

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to xlinked dystoniaparkinsonism ,mutations in and near the  gene can cause xlinked dystoniaparkinsonism the  gene provides instructions for making part of a protein called transcription factor iid tfiid this protein is active in cells and tissues throughout the body where it plays an essential role in regulating the activity of most genes  the  gene is part of a complex region of dna known as the  multiple transcript system this region consists of short stretches of dna from the  gene plus some extra segments of genetic material near the gene these stretches of dna can be combined in different ways to create various sets of instructions for making proteins researchers believe that some of these variations are critical for the normal function of nerve cells neurons in the brain  several changes in the  multiple transcript system have been identified in people with xlinked dystoniaparkinsonism scientists are uncertain how these changes are related to the movement abnormalities characteristic of this disease however they suspect that the changes disrupt the regulation of critical genes in neurons this defect leads to the eventual death of these cells particularly in areas of the brain called the caudate nucleus and putamen these regions are critical for normal movement learning and memory it is unclear why the effects of changes in the  multiple transcript system appear to be limited to dystonia and parkinsonism

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to bladder cancer ,as with most cancers the exact causes of bladder cancer are not known however many risk factors are associated with this disease many of the major risk factors are environmental such as smoking and exposure to certain industrial chemicals studies suggest that chronic bladder inflammation a parasitic infection called schistosomiasis and some medications used to treat cancer are other environmental risk factors associated with bladder cancer  genetic factors are also likely to play an important role in determining bladder cancer risk researchers have studied the effects of mutations in several genes including   hras  and  on the formation and growth of bladder tumors each of these genes plays a critical role in regulating cell division by preventing cells from dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way alterations in these genes may help explain why some bladder cancers grow and spread more rapidly than others  deletions of part or all of chromosome  are common events in bladder tumors researchers believe that several genes that control cell growth and division are probably located on chromosome  they are working to determine whether a loss of these genes plays a role in the development and progression of bladder cancer  most of the genetic changes associated with bladder cancer develop in bladder tissue during a persons lifetime rather than being inherited from a parent some people however appear to inherit a reduced ability to break down certain chemicals which makes them more sensitive to the cancercausing effects of tobacco smoke and industrial chemicals

symptoms,what are the symptoms of mondini dysplasia ,what are the signs and symptoms of mondini dysplasia mondini dysplasia is a congenital malformation present at birth it may occur either unilaterally in one ear or bilaterally in both ears most affected individuals have profound sensorineural hearing loss but some individuals do have residual hearing there have also been reports of affected individuals having normal hearing mondini dysplasia can also predispose to recurrent meningitis because the defect can act as a port of entry to the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord cerebrospinal fluid or csf sometimes individuals are not diagnosed before several episodes of recurrent meningitis occur the condition may occur with other abnormalities of the ear or other organs or it may be isolated the severity of the physical abnormality does not appear to correlate with the severity of the signs and symptoms in affected individuals
inheritance,is hereditary pancreatitis inherited ,when hereditary pancreatitis is caused by mutations in the  gene it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder in some cases an affected person inherits the  gene mutation from one affected parent other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family  it is estimated that  percent of people who have the altered  gene never have an episode of pancreatitis this situation is known as reduced penetrance it is unclear why some people with a mutated gene never develop signs and symptoms of the disease
inheritance,is  transient neonatal diabetes mellitus inherited ,most cases of  transient neonatal diabetes mellitus are not inherited particularly those caused by paternal uniparental disomy in these cases genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells eggs and sperm or in early embryonic development affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family  sometimes the genetic change responsible for  transient neonatal diabetes mellitus is inherited for example a duplication of genetic material on the paternal chromosome  can be passed from one generation to the next  when  transient neonatal diabetes mellitus is caused by  gene mutations it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition
exams and tests,how to diagnose atrial fibrillation ,"atrial fibrillation af is diagnosed based on your medical and family histories a physical exam and the results from tests and procedures
                
sometimes af doesnt cause signs or symptoms thus it may be found during a physical exam or ekg electrocardiogram test done for another purpose
                
if you have af your doctor will want to find out what is causing it this will help him or her plan the best way to treat the condition
                
specialists involved
                
primary care doctors often are involved in the diagnosis and treatment of af these doctors include family practitioners and internists
                
doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease also may be involved such as
                
cardiologists these are doctors who diagnose and treat heart diseases and conditions
                
electrophysiologists these are cardiologists who specialize in arrhythmias
                
medical and family histories
                
your doctor will likely ask questions about your
                
signs and symptoms what symptoms are you having have you had palpitations are you dizzy or short of breath are your feet or ankles swollen a possible sign of heart failure do you have any chest pain
                
medical history do you have other health problems such as a history of heart disease high blood pressure lung disease diabetes or thyroid problems
                
familys medical history does anyone in your family have a history of af has anyone in your family ever had heart disease or high blood pressure has anyone had thyroid problems does your family have a history of other illnesses or health problems
                
health habits do you smoke or use alcohol or caffeine
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will do a complete cardiac exam he or she will listen to the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat and take your pulse and blood pressure reading your doctor will likely check for any signs of heart muscle or heart valve problems he or she will listen to your lungs to check for signs of heart failure
                
your doctor also will check for swelling in your legs or feet and look for an enlarged thyroid gland or other signs of hyperthyroidism too much thyroid hormone
                
diagnostic tests and procedures
                
ekg
                
an ekg is a simple painless test that records the hearts electrical activity its the most useful test for diagnosing af
                
an ekg shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm steady or irregular it also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart
                
a standard ekg only records the heartbeat for a few seconds it wont detect af that doesnt happen during the test to diagnose paroxysmal af your doctor may ask you to wear a portable ekg monitor that can record your heartbeat for longer periods
                
the two most common types of portable ekgs are holter and event monitors
                
holter and event monitors
                
a holter monitor records the hearts electrical activity for a full  or  period you wear small patches called electrodes on your chest wires connect these patches to a small portable recorder the recorder can be clipped to a belt kept in a pocket or hung around your neck
                
you wear the holter monitor while you do your normal daily activities this allows the monitor to record your heart for a longer time than a standard ekg
                
an event monitor is similar to a holter monitor you wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities however an event monitor only records your hearts electrical activity at certain times while youre wearing it
                
for many event monitors you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms
                
you can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur
                
stress test
                
some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast during stress testing you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done if you cant exercise you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast
                
echocardiography
                
echocardiography echo uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart the test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working
                
echo also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart areas of heart muscle that arent contracting normally and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow
                
this test sometimes is called transthoracic transthorasik echocardiography its painless and noninvasive no instruments are inserted into the body for the test a device called a transducer is moved back and forth over your chest the device sends special sound waves through your chest wall to your heart
                
the sound waves bounce off the structures of your heart and a computer converts them into pictures on a screen
                
transesophageal echocardiography
                
transesophageal transesofahgeal echo or tee uses sound waves to take pictures of your heart through the esophagus the esophagus is the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach
                
your hearts upper chambers the atria are deep in your chest they often cant be seen very well using transthoracic echo your doctor can see the atria much better using tee
                
during this test the transducer is attached to the end of a flexible tube the tube is guided down your throat and into your esophagus youll likely be given medicine to help you relax during the procedure
                
tee is used to detect blood clots that may be forming in the atria because of af
                
chest x ray
                
a chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in your chest such as your heart and lungs this test can show fluid buildup in the lungs and signs of other af complications
                
blood tests
                
blood tests check the level of thyroid hormone in your body and the balance of your bodys electrolytes electrolytes are minerals that help maintain fluid levels and acidbase balance in the body theyre essential for normal health and functioning of your bodys cells and organs"

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to megdel syndrome ,megdel syndrome is caused by mutations in the  gene the function of the protein produced from this gene is not completely understood although research suggests that it is involved in altering remodeling certain fats called phospholipids particularly a phospholipid known as phosphatidylglycerol another phospholipid called cardiolipin is made from phosphatidylglycerol cardiolipin is a component of the membrane that surrounds cellular structures called mitochondria which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use and is important for the proper functioning of these structures   gene mutations involved in megdel syndrome lead to little or no  protein function as a result phosphatidylglycerol remodeling is impaired which likely alters the composition of cardiolipin researchers speculate that the abnormal cardiolipin affects mitochondrial function reducing cellular energy production and leading to the neurological and hearing problems characteristic of megdel syndrome it is unclear how  gene mutations lead to abnormal release of  acid in the urine although it is thought to be related to mitochondrial dysfunction
exams and tests,how to diagnose adrenal insufficiency and addisons disease ,"in its early stages adrenal insufficiency can be difficult to diagnose a health care provider may suspect it after reviewing a persons medical history and symptoms
                
a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is confirmed through hormonal blood and urine tests a health care provider uses these tests first to determine whether cortisol levels are too low and then to establish the cause imaging studies of the adrenal and pituitary glands can be useful in helping to establish the cause
                
a lab technician performs the following tests in a health care providers office a commercial facility or a hospital
                
hormonal blood and urine tests
                
 acth stimulation test the acth stimulation test is the most commonly used test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in this test the patient is given an intravenous iv injection of synthetic acth and samples of blood urine or both are taken before and after the injection the cortisol levels in the blood and urine samples are measured in a lab the normal response after an acth injection is a rise in blood and urine cortisol levels people with addisons disease or longstanding secondary adrenal insufficiency have little or no increase in cortisol levels  both low and highdose acth stimulation tests may be used depending on the suspected cause of adrenal insufficiency for example if secondary adrenal insufficiency is mild or has only recently occurred the adrenal glands may still respond to acth because they have not yet shut down their own production of hormone some studies have suggested a low  microgram mcgmay be more effective in detecting secondary adrenal insufficiency because the low dose is still enough to raise cortisol levels in healthy people yet not in people with mild or recent secondary adrenal insufficiency however recent research has shown that a significant proportion of healthy children and adults can fail the lowdose test which may lead to unnecessary treatment therefore some health care providers favor using a  mcg acth test for more accurate results    crh stimulation test when the response to the acth test is abnormal a crh stimulation test can help determine the cause of adrenal insufficiency in this test the patient is given an iv injection of synthetic crh and blood is taken before and    and  minutes after the injection the cortisol levels in the blood samples are measured in a lab people with addisons disease respond by producing high levels of acth yet no cortisol people with secondary adrenal insufficiency do not produce acth or have a delayed response crh will not stimulate acth secretion if the pituitary is damaged so no acth response points to the pituitary as the cause a delayed acth response points to the hypothalamus as the cause
                
diagnosis during adrenal crisis
                
although a reliable diagnosis is not possible during adrenal crisis measurement of blood acth and cortisol during the crisisbefore treatment with corticosteroids is givenis often enough to make a preliminary diagnosis low blood sodium low blood glucose and high blood potassium are also sometimes present at the time of adrenal crisis once the crisis is controlled an acth stimulation test can be performed to help make a specific diagnosis more complex lab tests are sometimes used if the diagnosis remains unclear"

genetic changes,what are the genetic changes related to danon disease ,danon disease is caused by mutations in the  gene the  gene provides instructions for making a protein called lysosomal associated membrane   which as its name suggests is found in the membrane of cellular structures called lysosomes lysosomes are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials the role the  protein plays in the lysosome is unclear some researchers think the  protein may help transport cellular materials or digestive enzymes into the lysosome the transport of cellular materials into lysosomes requires the formation of cellular structures called autophagic vacuoles or autophagosomes which then attach fuse to lysosomes the  protein may be involved in the fusion between autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes  mutations in the  gene lead to the production of very little or no  protein which may impair the process of transporting cellular material into the lysosome some studies have shown that in cells without the  protein fusion between autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes occurs more slowly which may lead to the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles people with danon disease have an abnormally large number of autophagic vacuoles in their muscle cells it is possible that this accumulation leads to breakdown of the muscle cells causing the muscle weakness seen in danon disease

information,what is are cough ,"a cough is a natural reflex that protects your lungs coughing helps clear your airways of lung irritants such as smoke and mucus a slimy substance this helps prevent infections a cough also can be a symptom of a medical problem
                
prolonged coughing can cause unpleasant side effects such as chest pain exhaustion lightheadedness and loss of bladder control coughing also can interfere with sleep socializing and work
                
overview
                
coughing occurs when the nerve endings in your airways become irritated the airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs certain substances such as smoke and pollen medical conditions and medicines can irritate these nerve endings
                
a cough can be acute subacute or chronic depending on how long it lasts
                
an acute cough lasts less than  weeks common causes of an acute cough are a common cold or other upper respiratory respirahtore infections examples of other upper respiratory infections include the flu pneumonia numoneah and whooping cough
                
a subacute cough lasts  to  weeks this type of cough remains even after a cold or other respiratory infection is over
                
a chronic cough lasts more than  weeks common causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome uacs asthma and gastroesophageal gastroehsofajeal reflux disease or gerd
                
uacs is a term used to describe conditions that inflame the upper airways and cause a cough examples include sinus infections and allergies these conditions can cause mucus to run down your throat from the back of your nose this is called postnasal drip
                
asthma is a longterm lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways gerd occurs if acid from your stomach backs up into your throat
                
outlook
                
the best way to treat a cough is to treat its cause for example asthma is treated with medicines that open the airways
                
your doctor may recommend cough medicine if the cause of your cough is unknown and the cough causes a lot of discomfort cough medicines may harm children if your child has a cough talk with his or her doctor about how to treat it"

susceptibility,who is at risk for anemia ,"anemia is a common condition it occurs in all age racial and ethnic groups both men and women can have anemia however women of childbearing age are at higher risk for the condition because of blood loss from menstruation
                
anemia can develop during pregnancy due to low levels of iron and folic acid folate and changes in the blood during the first  months of pregnancy the fluid portion of a womans blood the plasma increases faster than the number of red blood cells this dilutes the blood and can lead to anemia
                
during the first year of life some babies are at risk for anemia because of iron deficiency atrisk infants include those who are born too early and infants who are fed breast milk only or formula that isnt fortified with iron these infants can develop iron deficiency by  months of age
                
infants between  and  years of age also are at risk for anemia they may not get enough iron in their diets especially if they drink a lot of cows milk cows milk is low in the iron needed for growth
                
drinking too much cows milk may keep an infant or toddler from eating enough ironrich foods or absorbing enough iron from foods
                
older adults also are at increased risk for anemia researchers continue to study how the condition affects older adults many of these people have other medical conditions as well
                
major risk factors
                
factors that raise your risk for anemia include
                
a diet that is low in iron vitamins or minerals
                
blood loss from surgery or an injury
                
longterm or serious illnesses such as kidney disease cancer diabetes rheumatoid arthritis hivaids inflammatory bowel disease including crohns disease liver disease heart failure and thyroid disease
                
longterm infections

information,what is are holoprosencephaly ,"holoprosencephaly is a disorder caused by the failure of the prosencephalon the embryonic forebrain to sufficiently divide into the double lobes of the cerebral hemispheres the result is a singlelobed brain structure and severe skull and facial defects in most cases of holoprosencephaly the malformations are so severe that babies die before birth in less severe cases babies are born with normal or nearnormal brain development and facial deformities that may affect the eyes nose and upper lip
                
there are three classifications of holoprosencephaly alobar in which the brain has not divided at all is usually associated with severe facial deformities semilobar in which the brains hemispheres have somewhat divided causes an intermediate form of the disorder lobar in which there is considerable evidence of separate brain hemispheres is the least severe form in some cases of lobar holoprosencephaly the babys brain may be nearly normal
                
the least severe of the facial anomalies is the median cleft lip premaxillary agenesis the most severe is cyclopia an abnormality characterized by a single eye located in the area normally occupied by the root of the nose and a missing nose or a proboscis a tubularshaped nose located above the eye the least common facial anomaly is ethmocephaly in which a proboscis separates closelyset eyes cebocephaly another facial anomaly is characterized by a small flattened nose with a single nostril situated below incomplete or underdeveloped closelyset eyes"
exams and tests,how to diagnose heart palpitations ,"first your doctor will want to find out whether your palpitations are harmless or related to a heart problem he or she will ask about your symptoms and medical history do a physical exam and recommend several basic tests
                
this information may point to a heart problem as the cause of your palpitations if so your doctor may recommend more tests these tests will help show what the problem is so your doctor can decide how to treat it
                
the cause of palpitations may be hard to diagnose especially if symptoms dont occur regularly
                
specialists involved
                
several types of doctors may work with you to diagnose and treat your palpitations these include a
                
primary care doctor
                
cardiologist a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions
                
electrophysiologist a cardiologist who specializes in the hearts electrical system
                
medical history
                
your doctor will ask questions about your palpitations such as
                
when did they begin
                
how long do they last
                
how often do they occur
                
do they start and stop suddenly
                
does your heartbeat feel steady or irregular during the palpitations
                
do other symptoms occur with the palpitations
                
do your palpitations have a pattern for example do they occur when you exercise or drink coffee do they happen at a certain time of day
                
your doctor also may ask about your use of caffeine alcohol supplements and illegal drugs
                
physical exam
                
your doctor will take your pulse to find out how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is normal he or she also will use a stethoscope to listen to your heartbeat
                
your doctor may look for signs of conditions that can cause palpitations such as an overactive thyroid
                
diagnostic tests
                
often the first test thats done is an ekg electrocardiogram this simple test records your hearts electrical activity
                
an ekg shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm steady or irregular it also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart
                
even if your ekg results are normal you may still have a medical condition thats causing palpitations if your doctor suspects this is the case you may have blood tests to gather more information about your hearts structure function and electrical system
                
holter or event monitor
                
a standard ekg only records the heartbeat for a few seconds it wont detect heart rhythm problems that dont happen during the test to diagnose problems that come and go your doctor may have you wear a holter or event monitor
                
a holter monitor records the hearts electrical activity for a full  or  period you wear patches called electrodes on your chest wires connect the patches to a small portable recorder the recorder can be clipped to a belt kept in a pocket or hung around your neck
                
during the  or  period you do your usual daily activities you use a notebook to record any symptoms you have and the time they occur you then return both the recorder and the notebook to your doctor to read the results your doctor can see how your heart was beating at the time you had symptoms
                
an event monitor is similar to a holter monitor you wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities however an event monitor only records your hearts electrical activity at certain times while youre wearing it
                
for many event monitors you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms
                
you can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur
                
holter or event monitor
                

                
echocardiography
                
echocardiography uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart the picture shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working
                
the test also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart areas of heart muscle that arent contracting normally and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow
                
stress test
                
some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast during stress testing you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done if you cant exercise you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast"

                     after adult nonhodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body      there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body     stages of adult nonhodgkin lymphoma may include e and s     the following stages are used for adult nonhodgkin lymphoma          stage i      stage ii      stage iii      stage iv         adult nonhodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive and whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body
                
                
                    after adult nonhodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body
                    the process used to find out the type of cancer and if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment the results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose nonhodgkin lymphoma are used to help make decisions about treatment   the following tests and procedures may also be used in the staging process            complete blood count cbc with differential  a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following                 the number of red blood cells and platelets       the number and type of white blood cells       the amount of hemoglobin the protein that carries oxygen in the red blood cells       the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells                 blood chemistry studies  a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body an unusual higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of disease       ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as the lung lymph nodes and liver taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an xray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography       pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do        mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri        bone marrow aspiration and biopsy  the removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone a pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer       lumbar puncture  a procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid csf from the spinal column this is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the csf around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid the sample of csf is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord this procedure is also called an lp or spinal tap         for pregnant women with nonhodgkin lymphoma staging tests and procedures that protect the baby from the harms of radiation are used these tests and procedures include mri bone marrow aspiration and biopsy lumbar puncture and ultrasound an ultrasound exam is a procedure in which highenergy sound waves ultrasound are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram
                
                
                    there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body
                    cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood          tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas      lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body      blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body
                
                
                    stages of adult nonhodgkin lymphoma may include e and s
                    adult nonhodgkin lymphoma may be described as follows          e e stands for extranodal and means the cancer is found in an area or organ other than the lymph nodes or has spread to tissues beyond but near the major lymphatic areas     s s stands for spleen and means the cancer is found in the spleen
                
                
                    the following stages are used for adult nonhodgkin lymphoma

prevention,how to prevent kidney disease of diabetes ,"blood pressure medicines
                
scientists have made great progress in developing methods that slow the onset and progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes drugs used to lower blood pressure can slow the progression of kidney disease significantly two types of drugs angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease many people require two or more drugs to control their blood pressure in addition to an ace inhibitor or an arb a diuretic can also be useful beta blockers calcium channel blockers and other blood pressure drugs may also be needed
                
an example of an effective ace inhibitor is lisinopril prinivil zestril which doctors commonly prescribe for treating kidney disease of diabetes the benefits of lisinopril extend beyond its ability to lower blood pressure it may directly protect the kidneys glomeruli ace inhibitors have lowered proteinuria and slowed deterioration even in people with diabetes who did not have high blood pressure
                
an example of an effective arb is losartan cozaar which has also been shown to protect kidney function and lower the risk of cardiovascular events
                
patients with even mild hypertension or persistent microalbuminuria should consult a health care provider about the use of antihypertensive medicines
                
moderateprotein diets
                
in people with diabetes excessive consumption of protein may be harmful experts recommend that people with kidney disease of diabetes consume the recommended dietary allowance for protein but avoid highprotein diets for people with greatly reduced kidney function a diet containing reduced amounts of protein may help delay the onset of kidney failure anyone following a reducedprotein diet should work with a dietitian to ensure adequate nutrition
                
intensive management of blood glucose
                
antihypertensive drugs and lowprotein diets can slow ckd a third treatment known as intensive management of blood glucose or glycemic control has shown great promise for people with diabetes especially for those in the early stages of ckd
                
the human body normally converts food to glucose the simple sugar that is the main source of energy for the bodys cells to enter cells glucose needs the help of insulin a hormone produced by the pancreas when a person does not make enough insulin or the body does not respond to the insulin that is present the body cannot process glucose and it builds up in the bloodstream high levels of glucose in the blood lead to a diagnosis of diabetes
                
intensive management of blood glucose is a treatment regimen that aims to keep blood glucose levels close to normal the regimen includes testing blood glucose frequently administering insulin throughout the day on the basis of food intake and physical activity following a diet and activity plan and consulting a health care team regularly some people use an insulin pump to supply insulin throughout the day
                
a number of studies have pointed to the beneficial effects of intensive management of blood glucose in the diabetes control and complications trial supported by the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases niddk researchers found a  percent decrease in both development and progression of early diabetic kidney disease in participants who followed an intensive regimen for controlling blood glucose levels the intensively managed patients had average blood glucose levels of  milligrams per deciliterabout  milligrams per deciliter lower than the levels observed in the conventionally managed patients the united kingdom prospective diabetes study conducted from  to  showed conclusively that in people with improved blood glucose control the risk of early kidney disease was reduced by a third additional studies conducted over the past decades have clearly established that any program resulting in sustained lowering of blood glucose levels will be beneficial to patients in the early stages of ckd"
